            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: what's up my internet friends brian tong here and i'm sure you've heard about salesforce acquiring slack and all the new things that they're doing and if you haven't you can watch my breakdown of it right here but look we are here because everyone loves a countdown and if you aren't using slack for business what are you even doing so today i'm telling you the top 10 ways slack can increase your productivity and collaboration so let's get right to it at number 10 channels you can organize your teams around a common goal using channels if slack is your entire body that handles all of your functions well channels are at the heart of slack and it's what makes everything go and it's the foundation for what separates slack from its competitors you can create channels on your own for everything and everyone from co-workers to external business partners it allows different members from different teams to collaborate based on a specific topic or task to complete and yes you can make a channel for your favorite instant pot recipes come on now let's trade a few but without channels slack ain't slack at number 9 emojis or what i like to call emojis yeah sure you're using this for work but slack is personality respond with a check mark for completed use the eyes for taking a look what's the light bulb for a great idea high five hands nicely done thumbs up is a plus one and bullseye means exactly look emojis take on another language in slack and use those prayer hands to say thank you or beg for a raise slack has emojis at numero ocho slack connect business moves so quickly so speed up your collaboration with your business partners with slack connect slack connect allows you to work with people outside of your company with shared channels and direct messages it moves the conversations you used to have in emails and then takes them directly to slack securely hey me likey and it makes collaborating easier with a direct connection with teams at number seven huddles how many of you watching this are sitting inside your company's office right now you know i'm going to guess more than half of you probably aren't because we're working remotely but then how do you stay connected and have interactions just like you would at the office while wearing your favorite fuzzy bunny slippers well you could do calls or screen sharing directly from slack but even better slack huddles let you have quick mini meetings with your team on the spot think of it like those hallway conversations that you'd have at the office instead it's a spontaneous audio chat that's just easy to jump into on the fly when people are available okay alright everybody break six on the list is focus time integrate google calendar to set focus time so you can focus on the most important work you can automatically sync your slack status with your google calendar so everyone can see your availability just add the google calendar app from the slack app directory and it syncs together like magic you know it's one of the over 2400 apps that are available for you depending on the type of work you do so when you're busy finishing a deadline or you're watching that latest music video from bts that they just dropped and you cannot be bothered hey both of these are equally important coming in at number five get rid of the noise eliminate noise by turning off notifications look we all know slack gun of slack it just don't stop so pause your notifications with do not disturb just go to your profile pic in the top right of the app and click it hover over pause notifications then choose a time frame and you are set to dnd oh sorry dungeons and dragons fans um i'm gonna get you all excited but dmd here stands for do not disturb hey we've got the final four to go but i really need to take a breather i'm just going to get a sip of water here and while i do that if you want to learn more about the slack playlist on salesforce plus hey just click over here all right i just gotta loosen my throat okay that was good all right let's get back down to the countdown at four set sync and share if you're stepping away from slack to grab some lunch maybe you're going on vacation for a week or just plugging in for a few hours you can create a custom status in slack to manage your co-workers expectations now you can set your status right from your profile and you have five default choices you can change how long it is and whether or not to pause notifications or you can make a custom one now your status can also sync with apps for slack so your google calendar will update your status if you have meetings planned and it will also automatically update if you're on a voice or video call in slack and then reset when you're done at number three real real-time collaboration tools i mentioned earlier how there are over 2400 apps that you can connect with slack that help streamline tasks your workflow and collaboration and really one of the best things to do is integrate apps you use directly into slack there's just so many of them for disciplines like project management marketing sales and analytics but they all allow you to handle your business with slack and here's a heart emoji for that because i love it so much tier emoji coming in at number two workflow builder simplify and speed up everyday processes with workflow builder this is another part of the magic of slack because workflow builder allows you to do everything from request time off submit salesforce cases and add new details to your crm they are pre-built workflows that allow you to do more complex tasks in just a few clicks no coding required and finally we have reached the mountaintop at number one apps for slack you want to unlock your productivity and be more efficient yes you should all be nodding your heads right now jamie yeah i'm waiting for you jamie yes thank you now here are five apps in no particular order to help you do just that build a self-service help desk with help because everyone needs some help team culture is everything so sweeten it up with donut the app and real donuts help too you can drive business growth with drift you want to see how your team feels about their next goal take your team's pulse with simple pull and link up your tools with zapier to connect key apps and automate your workflows and make them zapier it's in the name now these are some of the apps that unlock your productivity in slack so what do you all think of that top 10 list you know personally i would have you know maybe bumped one of them higher and i think you know what it is emojis okay i'll stop that i swear but there you go the top 10 ways slack increases productivity and collaboration hey you're not done yet don't forget to like subscribe and turn on your notifications to get more videos like this from salesforce\n",

            "So, what is a channel? Well channels help   organize conversations and topics. Now earlier I \n",

            "options. I could set notification settings for   this specific channel. So, for instance I could \n",
            "be notified about any conversations occurring   or maybe only when someone @ mentions me. An @ \n",
            "mention is when someone is specifically calling   me out for my attention. Let's say that there's \n",
            "a channel that doesn't interest me at all. I can   mute the channel. I could even leave a channel \n",

            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: Hey, everyone, I'm Tamar, and I lead product at Slack. Some legalese first. Some of what you see here may be forward looking, so I want to encourage everyone to please make your purchasing decisions based on products and services that are currently available. That said, let me tell you about Slack. Slack is where work happens. Whether it's working across teams and time zones, synchronous or asynchronous, in-person or remote, structured or informal, Slack is the Digital HQ for all businesses. Slack brings people and information\n",
            "together in Channels, builds relationships with partners and customers in Slack Connect and connects your systems and people together with Slack Workflows. Let's take a look. Here we are in Slack, where it's easy to find all the people you work with, communicate directly with them and collaborate as a team. Channels are listed on the left hand side and can be created for any project, topic or team. A Channel's a space that has all the right people, files and conversations in one place. They're useful for so many things: team communication, org-wide announcements, incident management and so much more. Everyone knows exactly where to go for the information they need. One of my favorite examples is how we use channels for building new product features. Every feature has its own channel. All the people working on the feature documents, explaining the feature and comments and feedback are in one place. It's open and transparent for anyone in the company to follow along, no matter what team they're in or where they are. Video, voice and screen recordings are also great to share in Slack. When working remotely, a video helps you have a sense of belonging. It captures nuance in ways that text alone can't. For example, in this design team channel, designers often post video messages to show off new designs. People respond with questions or just encouragement, with a video or in any format they want. Bonus points, doing this asynchronously removes the need for a meeting. Teams also communicate through Huddles, a lightweight audio first way of spinning up a live conversation in any channel. Huddles create those spontaneous interactions you used to have at the office. Like after a customer call when you used to walk over to somebody's desk. Now you just jump on a huddle to debrief. Anyone available can join and the best part: they're live captioned, so it's accessible to everyone And everything added to Slack becomes part of a searchable repository. That's right. All the conversations, information and people are searchable. Yes. Even those video and voice messages. Slack Search is a central place to discover all of the information when you need it. It also makes it easy for new employees and team members to come up to speed. Slack Connect is a secure space that connects you with people outside your organization, the same way you connect with teams inside your organization. For example, I share product plans with our customer advisory board and they give me feedback in our shared channel. From retailers to the world's largest financial services firms, over 91,000 companies are running their businesses on Slack Connect to work in a new way without all the planes, trains and automobiles. But communication at work doesn't just happen between people. We also work with data and other systems. A typical enterprise uses more than a thousand different software tools. Slack makes it easy to bring them together in one place. The Slack App Directory has over 2,500 apps for you to connect into your channels. When I need to prep for a customer meeting, I frequently use the Salesforce integration to pull up real time customer information. I get what I need without having to ask anyone or schedule a meeting. Same goes for any type of app from document sharing and web meetings to H.R. and budget apps. It's all there in one place without having to leave Slack. It's easy to use all of these systems and customize workflows for your unique way of working with our Workflow Builder. You could add workflows to channels to automate tasks. For example, share updates, run a virtual stand up or moderate a live Q&A session. All without writing any code. Millions of people use workflows every day to streamline work and save time. As we like to say, when work flows, customer success grows. So that's a quick look at our product. We have an incredible vision for the future. That vision was built together with our customers, and T-Mobile is one of those customers. Today, nearly one 100,000 T-Mobile employees are using Slack with over 6,000 workflows and delivering for over 102 million customers. Now, let's see how Slack and Salesforce work together. For that, let me get help from a friend. Thanks Tamar! Let's do this. We've completely transformed Customer 360 to be Slack-first. What that means is you can create workflows across any line of business, whether it's sales, service, marketing and more. IBM is using Salesforce and Slack to become more connected, more productive and more innovative. This is truly the future of work. Your Digital HQ, powering success from anywhere. Let's see the Slack-first Customer 360 come to life in a demo, starting with marketing. IBM marketers use Slack-first Marketing to be data driven, delivering effective campaigns and growth. Tableau operates on autopilot, sending pipeline reports for marketers to view right in their channel. And when a campaign needs a boost, teams are notified. They don't need a 30 minute meeting. Just jump in a Slack Huddle for a quick call. Here they make a data-driven decision to create a video for the IBM Data Fabric product, and they need outside help to make it happen. It's easy to engage people outside your company, such as an agency via Slack Connect. Whether sharing briefs or documents or anything, it's all secure and in one place. Important items are bookmarked. No more time wasted searching for stuff in email. And providing feedback is fun, too. IBM uses emojis and reactjis to respond, even approve. My favorite is this dancing pony plus a good ol' confetti pop. Now, sharing content is easy and the best part: of all of this is directly in Slack. No toggling between apps. All the work just flows. With Slack-first Marketing, when work flows, relationships grow. Now let's see how IBM sales teams are working in Slack. IBM reps start their day and their Digital HQ with personalized Daily Briefs. They make the most of every minute with prioritized tasks, meetings and deals. And any new important information from across the company. That new IBM Data Fabric video is out and creating buzz. The team wants to work on a deal strategy around this. Collaborating on accounts and opportunities is easy in the deal rooms. Deal rooms like this one bring together all the right people, files and conversations from across the organization for teams to work together. Think about all the people across sales, legal, finance, operations, products, support and marketing and more that are needed to get deals done. Workflows streamline these business processes. Here, the IBM rep uses an \"Exec Sponsor Request\" to speed up a deal cycle. And Workflows help with so much more. Meeting notes are automatically added, new contacts are automatically created and reps are notified of account updates - all in Slack. Deals are done in record time. With Slack-first Sales, when work flows, revenue grows. Personally, I do love saving time to get more done and focus. Speaking of getting more done, the team is over there working really hard. I should send them a pizza. And of course I can do that right in Slack. So easy! And you know what else is easy? IBM's Customer Service. IBM service agents use Slack-first Service. They spend their day working cases and solving problems for their customers across every channel. And what happens when they need to escalate for help? They use swarms like this one to work together and resolve issues faster. Expert Finder identifies the right team members to add a channel based on their skills. No more guesswork. All the necessary and related information like case status metrics, customer details, history, the SLA and more are all in the swarm. From the moment a case swarm is started, the right teams are notified so they can take action. So check this out. Because we have a single view of the customer, workflows temporarily pause automated marketing emails and notify sales reps, helping everyone put customers first. You don't want them getting a marketing promotion or a sales call during a case escalation. Right? When everyone is working together with a single view of the customer, problems are solved faster and customers are happier. Case closed. With Slack-first Service, when work flows customer satisfaction grows. Now, IBM's sales, service and marketing teams are working together in their Digital HQ. With a Slack-first Customer 360, they succeed from anywhere, keeping the pipeline growing, deals closing, and customers smiling. Let's take it home with this big IBM Data Fabric deal. Right in Slack, With DocuSign seamlessly integrated, the contract is signed, reps are reminded to keep their opportunities up to date and the deal is done. To put a bow on it, let's congratulate everyone and thank the teams. Right from the channel, everyone shares personal videos with fun and flair. It's not just a win, it's a team celebration. Did someone order a pizza? You bet I did. How can it work for you? Check out the link. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.\n",

            "you and available for later. They use a fairly deep and good level of encryption\n",
            "as far as security goes so you’re in very good shape as far as all of that and it’s\n",
            "very flexible. You could set it up for multiple teams. I’ve got it set up for my DottoTech team,\n",

            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: what's up everybody brian tong here and if you're looking to learn about slack you came to the right place or if you're already slack pro and you think you got this you might be able to pick up a few things and if you just came here to hang out hi now i'm sure you've heard about salesforce acquiring slack and all the big things that they're doing together and if you haven't stop what you're doing and watch my breakdown of it right here but today i'm going to teach you how to use slack and we are really going to break it down now there's a lot you might not even know about it so we're gonna start out with the basics and spell it out for you okay s l a c k slack oh you thought i was kidding didn't you well slack is a messaging app for business and it's transformed the way organizations communicate it's efficient it's direct it's fun and it also makes emails feel slow in our cake now so let's just jump into it and first launch the slack app but right now we're looking at the app and this is straightforward but really this app is broken into two parts the sidebar on the left where you can access all of your conversations in slack and these can be channels you follow or direct messages with specific people and then the right side is where all your actual messages and conversations appear now when a channel's name is bold that means you have unread messages in it and if you see a badge that means someone has mentioned you and you'll probably want to jump in and respond and if you want to write a message to start any conversation you can use the compose button but let's really get into the app and really the secret sauce of slack is all about channels a channel is a dedicated space that brings the right people together for a project and a channel could focus around a new company initiative it could be about any topic like people who like sneakers at your company and just want to talk about sneakers or it could be a specific team so let's say a channel could be just for the video production team at your company channels these are focused around specific topics so you can join and leave them as needed and you'll also have direct messages and these are what they sound like they are direct private messages with one or more people i know that's tricky now ask your boss to approve that vacation time or i could get ricky to sign off on the jokes in my script for the latest video you can do that all with a direct message okay let's start by composing a message now go up to that compose message icon and click on it to write and send a message to either a channel or a direct message messages will automatically be saved in your drafts in the sidebar until you send them you can also have fun in slack with different formatting like using bold or using italic text or putting your thoughts out as bullet points you can use mentions to get that specific attention of a specific person in a conversation you can also drag and drop files directly into a conversation to share more information or attach them the hard way by navigating through your computer and going to files and folders hey that's your choice and if you post a message that you don't like you can go back and correct typos or mistakes after you've sent it or even just delete it if you need to start over now notifications here act a little differently when you see one in the sidebar it means someone has mentioned you and needs your attention and if there's any new activity in a channel or direct message the name appears in bold in the sidebar to let you know so mama did all that make sense so far if not you know just rewind and watch that whole first part again okay now let's level up some and i know we mentioned in the beginning of this video what makes slack unique is its channels so let's just get the most out of them and if you're new here you need to know everything you can about channels you might get invited to be in one but once you're part of a channel you can click on the actual name of it in the sidebar to see details about it who's in it the channel topic and description and any files or attachments that have been added to it the key thing about a channel is that it's a dedicated space to add messages and add files with multiple people that are related to this topic project or team and then you can also scroll up to check out its entire history every time you open one or just join one as a new member for the first time so now let's actually create a channel this is straightforward and when i hover over the word channels on the sidebar i will see the plus sign and that will allow me to add channels now when i click on it i can either browse channels available or create a new one now i'm going to create a new one and call it mcu that stands for marvel cinematic universe because who doesn't want to talk about the latest marvel movie or disney plush show constantly oh you don't well i do and you can add a description here you can make it private if you only want it to be invitation only because you think you're really cool now i'm going to create it and at that point you can add names to people from your company or invite people via email to be part of the channel once people have joined it's going to take on a life of its own because it's slack and let's be honest if you're part of a channel you want to have fun with it so you can always access the entire collection of emojis and use them anytime to have some fun in the conversation alright let's get to more basics in slack there's a whole lot more you do in the navigation bar at the top of the slack app now above the sidebar on the top left you're gonna see two arrows that are called history icons think of these arrows as like a web browser when you go back and forth between pages except in slack when you click on them it will go back and forth through your history of what you did whether it was sending a message checking out a conversation or creating a channel and if you click on the clock icon you can revisit all of your recent actions this is your history of actions in slack now you can't miss the search bar on the top and it does what you think it does it will search your entire conversation history in slack to find relevant messages files channels and people you're looking for to get work done based on what you search and everyone hey we all need help sometimes so click on the question mark icon to the right of the search bar to access help and learning resources directly in the slack app but i think some of the power in slack here is also in that top right hand corner where you see your profile picture or icon because when you click on it there are two really important features one of them is the first thing you see it's called update your status and guess what you can update your status here by typing in something like grabbing a bite to eat at shake shack but then there's other pre-made options you can choose like in a meeting or commuting and once you set your status you can select the amount of time that you think you remain at that status before it clears so it can be anything from 30 minutes to a few hours or even the next week plus you can also pause your notifications once you set it because we know that slack is this constantly living and breathing thing and if you've connected your google calendar and other apps to slack it will automatically change your status if you have a scheduled meeting so it can do all the work for you too now let's get back to that profile image when you click on it you'll also see the option to pause notifications i said slack is a living and breathing thing and sometimes notifications are just overwhelming even if you are available you have the ability to pause them for a certain amount of time or even create a notification schedule for the hours you choose so really you got to just start digging into slack and figure out what works best for you it's not too complicated but you also have to use it to master it and then once you do you might not want to use email ever again you can also check out the slack playlist on salesforce plus to learn more in even greater detail if you click right over here so there you go a little 101 from yours truly on how to use slack and if you learn something or you like what you see hey subscribe to this channel and turn those notifications to get the latest videos when they drop but until next time see ya\n",

i'm looking for my firebase over here and i've got my code editor over here perfect i don't need the terminal anymore so i can close that so at this point guys what i want to do is i want to go to the

it's gonna be something new for everyone who's watching on this channel and uh and guys trust me when i say this code is clean it is clean this is like one of the cleanest bits of code i've written so let's jump into this all right go ahead over to app.js and what i want to do is i don't need the app.test.js file logo svg and setup test so this will freeze my computer because if my loyal followers know i can't delete stuff and without it dying so i'm going to move to trash and we're just going to wait oh wow it actually worked people like going on papa fam will know that that's been a struggle all right let's carry on nice so what we're going to do here is grab everything inside the header and boom i'm going to type in h1 and let's say let's build slack let's build slack boom and then i'm going to go ahead and delete these two lines right here we don't need the counter we don't need the logo and i'm going to change this to a lowercase a however we're going to be using um we're not using bem today we're using style components so it's going to be a lot of fun right a hell of a lot of fun now what i want to do is command j right on jay open up my terminal and while everything's working we're gonna go ahead and click this features over here now i want you guys to pay like very close attention to what i'm about to do okay so inside of features right we have counter slice now what i want you to do is grab counter slice and drag it on top of features because what's actually happened is it's inside of a photo called counter okay so i want you to drag counter slice on top of features click move now you can see it's outside the counter folder so at this point i want you to right click on counter and click delete right we don't want the counter folder anymore okay perfect now we have counter slice and this is all part of redux okay so everything here is part of redux and i really love nj dave's comment here he says repetition is the best way to learn and dude i completely agree with you honestly i completely agree with you repetition is the way to go right at this point we're going to get an error so i want to go into my app store.js and here because we got rid of that counter folder i need to go here and say boom get rid of that so it's features forward slash counter slice now we will be renaming this in a bit but we'll come back to redux in a second okay so delete through the terminal says robert hey i have actually done that before it's actually quicker um hash says dad i can donate here paypal give me your link oh thank you dude there's a link to donate inside the description um there's a tips and donation link thank you so much dude appreciate you all right let's carry on guys so um we're going to go back to our app.js and here inside the terminal i'm going to go ahead and type in yarn start because we're using yarn today because that's what we do now right before we used to use npm but you know i started to enjoy the the yarn side of things like some some people are looking at me right now like with that with that evil eye they're just like yo why why don't you use npm but here's what it is you know right so now we're gonna carry on i've already got an app running on this port over here so i'm going to click on yes we'll open it up on 3001 and just while this loads guys i just want to run you through the app one more time okay so we have our amazing chat functionality over here right so this is a fully fledged slack phone right it says fully fledged if we go into like a chat over here i'm going to show you how to deploy all this we have this beautiful sidebar everything over here you can see it pulls our name from and our picture from google login really really nice stuff and you can go ahead and even add a channel let's go ahead and say this was like let's just say it's a papa cha right okay and let's jump into the puppet chat and this guy said you see it says message papa so if i go ahead and say yo what's up and look at that guys we get a nice slack interface right so really really slick okay and this is going to be using style components is so clean honestly i really want you guys to look forward to this now um if i click this and there you see right so you can go and sign up so i'm going to sign in one more time so that we have this as a reference and then i'm going to be building a fresh app out of this right so now i'm going to go over and while this is loading give it one second i'm just going to quickly log into that account and then this will redirect in just a sec i'm going to go ahead and pull over the local host one so this is our fresh app okay it says let's build slack this is where you guys should be at this point now i do want to mention if you can't or you find it hard to kind of code along with me then remember guys the second link in the description actually actually has the link to the papa github repo which is actually on sale as well right now we have 25 off and you can pretty much go ahead grab it and it's got the code for slack inside of it as well as every single clone i've ever done before make sure you go ahead and check it out if you get stuck and you know you can't keep up with everything that's going on so it will help you out in terms of sticking uh and sticking up to speed with me okay so let's carry on guys uh please don't spam the chat dude so i'm gonna go ahead and chuck you in timeout so don't spam that and everyone's asking about why i've left cp uh guys there's i don't need a reason i just don't wanna i wanna kind of carry on in my own route and i've built i feel like i can deliver actual value here in the way that i feel is most efficient okay and plus we've got the pop of fam guys like get with it right let's carry on let's go let's build slack all right so the first thing we want to do right this is going to be a slightly different tutorial right so the first thing we want to do is we will be using react router in today's build right so that way we can have pagering inside of our application so a lot a lot of fun in today's build okay and guys we're almost at 200 likes to smash the likes let's get them up right we were at 200 before it even started so this is gonna be a fresh one the first stream went down but we are not going to let this one beat us okay so first thing we're going to do is i'm going to go ahead and install reactor router so i'm going to go over here and say react router in google okay we're going to wait till this loads out and then i'm going to go to the react rear docks right and let's see and let's click on declarative routing for react.js and this way a sag there we go the stream's perfectly fine at this point jump over to twitch if you're having any issues so at this point we can go ahead and we're going to copy this we need to install reactor or dom okay so i'm going to copy this go back to my app and i like to have a split terminal so a lot of people don't like to have sort of split there the second one i like to have a split terminal because then i can see both things at once but what i do is i make this one smaller okay so that way i can see everything here i'll say yarn add and i'll do react with dom boom okay muhammad says i love you sonny you're just amazing thank you dude what's up assad good to see you man right so we're installing reactor or dom so now we have reactor inside our app the easiest way to get this up and running go ahead copy the import statements let's go ahead and pop this in right here boom copy and let's go ahead and paste it over here and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to grab everything inside of router there we go and then this jump over here right so a tau says hey sonny can we use react hooks over redux of course you can let's go ahead and paste it inside of here right and i'm going to get rid of my h1 over here so at this point if we save our application you should be able to see what i see at this point right so we've got a router and what we want to do is everything inside the nav we don't want that okay i don't really care about all that stuff right now we don't care about that right then the thing that i need next is i'm going to change this div into an actual just a fragment okay because i actually don't need that div at this point i'm going to get rid of this comment now what is a react router okay so react router allows us to have different pages on our website so if we go to forward slash it will take us to this home component if we go to four slash users it will take us to the user's component and if we go to forward slash about it will take us to the about component now we don't have these pages so for now i'm gonna go ahead and get rid of them okay so at this point i'm gonna go ahead and do this uh harsh please don't spam dude i will be sending it out right so i'm gonna go ahead and say h1 and let's just say this is the home page and just to make it extremely clear now when we're on the homepage what will happen is i'm going to make it firstly an exact route which means you have to land on the home page only and now if we go back to our application let's go ahead and check it out it says this is the home page okay perfect stuff works just as we expected it so now we have a reactor set up your garage says i recently got an intercham internship because of you your youtube channel streams thanks dude and great job you did that dude that's amazing i'd love to have you inside the papa fam so check it out zero to full stack hero first link in description do jump in with us please i love having success stories inside of it and we have we literally had gwen and alex who just landed jobs as well so crazy stuff let's carry on guys right so christopher says tell you sunny thanks for the quality lessons with you i hope i was able to get a job with a fortune 500 company let's go man that's sick well done dude that is so sick dude that is incredible stuff right so now we've got the homepage here so what we need to do now app.css clear everything we don't want anything go to index.css and at the top i want to do the following i want to say target everything with a margin of zero and what i'm going to do is you guys love when i do this i'm going to go ahead and pop this on one side and pop the co the actual application on the other side so let's go ahead and pop this over here perfect so now you guys can see i've got if i go ahead and add this margin of zero you guys should be able to see let me go ahead and get rid of that you see this little imaginary gap over here right this is going to go ahead and disappear when we add a margin of zero so if i go ahead and save you can see boom it gets rid of the imaginary gap okay so that's the first step that we wanted to do the second step i actually want to do is i'm going to set something in body today right i'm going to set a css variable now css variable is a very similar to a javascript variable pretty much it just holds a value okay so what we're going to do is i'm going to have a slack color right css variable and this is how we define it right we pretty much just say slack color and then we do this we just give it the color and now we can go ahead and access the slack color like so okay and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and say overflow hidden so that way in case we have any overflow inside of our app we're going to hide it okay so i'm just going to protect myself later on so now boom get rid of that and then get rid of that now we're back inside of app.js so firstly i'm going to mark out the application okay so let's look at the final application and see what we got to do so we have a few things in this build right we have the header so we have this beautiful header over here okay we have a nice looking header we have a sidebar over here we have a chat input component we have the chat itself over here and we also have the login stuff right so if i want to go ahead go ahead and go back here we have the login page so what i might do first is actually build maybe the uh let's build now let's start building the app first it's always funny to start building the actual application first so i'm going to go ahead and start doing that one first i encourage many friends of mine to watch your videos hashtag pop file that's what we're talking about guys amazing stuff all right atar says bro just do one session on react hooks dude i cover all of that inside the zurich full stack hero first line dude best community on the planet i said it because it's true period let's carry on all right so this is the home page okay and you know you're good when you start getting people a couple your builds you know it's pretty fun pretty fun when you get that all right so i'm going to go ahead and save there we go and then here you can see i have um hey nice fin okay let's carry on so we've got the home page over here right so what i'm going to do now is for the home page i'm going to go ahead and actually firstly let's go ahead and do the the header component okay so i'm going to go ahead and set up a header component so over here i'm gonna go ahead and say okay the header will go here the header like so right so what i need to do is obviously create a header component so i'm gonna say header dot js now i'm using snippets okay so i'm using rfce allows me to create a functional component how did i do that in case you're new to the channel go to extensions and you want to make sure you get this extension right here es7 react redux graphql react native snippets they are incredible okay really really incredible stuff and uh yeah just make sure you you you download this look 2 million 2 million 2.3 2.4 million wow crazy stuff right let's carry on so at this point we've got the header okay so let's jump into the header and see what we need so the first thing i'm going to need inside the header is let's have a look here we have a header left section so i'm going to assume that this is my header left section and then i have a header middle with this fancy input and then i have a header right with just this little icon over here now how do i get these icons right i need something called material ui right so i'm going to go ahead and jump into that right now i'm going to go ahead and go over to materialui.com and i'm going to install this into my project so the first thing i want to do is it says npm install material ui now if i'm using yarn i simply copy i jump over command j and i do yarn add material ui call okay so that will work perfectly for me at this point what i can do what's that print up i can go here and say icons because what you need to do is you need to in install the core as well as the icons that come with material ui so i'm going to go ahead and copy that as well and then once it's done i'm going to say yarn add material ui icons boom perfect right mr zach says what's the subject today what are we building all right we're going to be building the slack clone right but it's a redux styled components jacked up version incredible stuff right um there is a link in the description dude you can go ahead and check it out it's at the bottom thank you so much dude right so at this point what we're going to do we're going to go ahead and say uh we've already done this now to search for those icons i'd simply go to this link here where it says you can search for the full list of these icons i click that okay and then here you can see i've got a search right so if i go ahead and type in send for example it'll give me a send icon and they'll give me the import statement for it this is how i go ahead and do that right this is how i find all the icons that we're going to need throughout the builds okay now guys we're almost at 200 likes smash that thumbs up button to help this video get out to as many people as possible it's going to be a hell of a lot of fun today guys let's carry on right we would have been a 400 if that's stupid internet right but it's fine we're all good we're stronger than this i think we can keep pushing i really think we can keep going right so at this point i'm going to go ahead and say um close this because we've already got that right so we have the header now i'm going to be using styled components now what are styled components okay styled components are simply put we're not going to be using css in this in the traditional way where we import a css file and then we kind of you know we style out some stuff and we use the bem naming convention typically where a div has a class name and then we sort of target the class name but today we're changing things right we're changing it up we're going to be using something called start components now i want to show you what style components are all about why they're so popular okay so start components they have pretty much the power behind um they're pretty much more powerful than css modules they do a lot of head like uh of heavy lifting for you behind the scenes and they make your app extremely fast now if you're wondering who uses it just check out this list right tons of places use this thing right so all these folks use it vimeo vogue uh the onion i don't know what that is but uh eurostar coinbase get that dodge coin guys get right and this is pretty much how we define it you pretty much use define a variable so imagine we want to define a button and then you pretty much say style dot and then you give this sort of if it was a div here i'd say div and then you pretty much give some css inside of it now trust me it's not as tricky as you think okay it's really not that tricky i'm going to show you guys how to do it all so we're going to click documentation and we're going to click installation over here okay so it says npm install and then start components and guys this is the proper fam video okay so like if you want to be a part of the platform community first link in the description make sure you check it out we're already 200 strong inside the community it's crazy so i'm going to go ahead and grab start components here and i'm going to say yarn add styled components boom okay um perfect gwen says i love the fact that we can actually pause the video and i'm gonna go to the bottom okay so to make sure i'm at the bottom i go to the second last tag comma and i'm gonna go ahead and paste so you see resolution styled components right so it's very simple thing you just need to copy what i just did there okay 200 likes that's what i'm talking about guys see we had issues with the internet we didn't let that stop us papa fam is way stronger than that i love you guys thank you so much honestly just keep on going all right i'm gonna hit save on that and it's still installing styled components so we can give that just to sex and uh be patient with that one right and you can see pretty much after that we can just use them okay so we're gonna use that firstly inside of the uh inside of our header component and trust me guys it will make a lot of sense when we jump into this and when we start running with it okay so we're gonna pretty much just okay we're gonna get get ready for this okay um so let's carry on guys and uh what we're gonna do now is all right so please don't spam dude i hate it when people spam like i'm actually gonna block people from this channel if you spam so ayushman dude you're out right let's go so um what we're gonna it was installing the style components that's why i was kind of freaking out so at this point we have style components installed okay so what we're gonna do is is we're gonna go here and even this one dude wow so many people are spamming dude so any moderator so pranav do you mind just sort of you know you can time out people i'll give you permission go ahead and just clean up that chat right so over here what we're gonna do is i'm gonna go ahead and rather than having divs right this is how we use styled components okay so i'm going to make this a little bit bigger for you guys i think that might be easier for you to see so how do we go ahead and use a first thing is we don't have a css file which is really nice in that sense okay we get rid of the css file now what we do is actually lives underneath oh which is really nice in that sense okay that's the sort of standard that we should be doing okay so it should live underneath the uh the stream over there so at this point what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and say let's go ahead and have a header container okay so i'm going to say const header container like this okay equals styled right because it's styled components which we have to import oh no it's not that one oops not that definitely not that one all right what we're going to do instead we're going to import it and we're going to go ahead and say import styled from styled components like this we say style.div okay now here what we need to do is go ahead and do backticks so these are not regular ticks guys okay so they're back ticks okay you do back ticks and then what you want to do is start styling it okay so let's just say imagine the color of the text here was red okay so we said color let's just say red okay so these are back ticks etc let's go ahead and do that and then oops i need to go ahead mine has like nice syntax highlighting okay and you might be wondering but sunny mine looks a bit like this right everything is this color now what you need to do okay is you need to go ahead and guys if anyone's having issues with the internet pretty much just go ahead and uh refresh your browser and it should be all good to go now okay so we should be fine you just need to do a refresh and it's all good okay so at this point what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and i'm just going to play my music instead of doing the uh the other one okay there we go so at this point what we're going to do is go ahead and jump over to your extensions okay so over here in the extensions panel i'm going to go ahead into extensions and you want to grab this over here okay so grab the where is it gone you want to make sure you get vs code styled component extension and what this does is it gives you color syntax highlighting for your start components without it it's going to be a bit of a headache okay and uh guys if anyone asks why i'm not with cp anymore i'm just going to block you honestly it's really annoying guys i'm i deliver more value over here period and we've got you know chill out all right let's carry on right so i'm going to go ahead and get rid of this one the stream has not ended you can just refresh dude all right so at this point where we have the header okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to say header container okay and now you can see what's happened is this is simply got these styles injected into it so now if i have a h1 which says test okay and i go into my app.js and i import the header like so and i save i'm going to go ahead and pop this to the side and let's go ahead and go back over here okay now inside of here you can see what the really cool thing about this right is if i go ahead and say background color let's do background color red and then i'm going to go ahead and refresh let me see my header container is a style div there we go the background color is red um interesting okay let's double check what's going on here but what we want to do is let's just start jumping into actually the coding aspect of it oh there we go that's why um okay i know why so at this point imagine i want to target that h1 what i need to do is i just go ahead and say okay target the h1 inside of here and give it a color of red so let's go ahead and do color of red like this save right and this will go ahead and uh this will actually this will do it right it's actually i'm not sure why it's not rendering let's double check what's happening over here right so what i would recommend is if you do experience any of these issues ctrl c and then you're gonna do yarn start again okay the reason why this is happening is because we've installed style components we need to make sure that we go ahead and restart our terminal i'm gonna do y 3001 and then we'll wait for this to start up again okay right and i'm gonna go ahead and refresh save perfect now style div okay i'm gonna say color let's just say green and then let's go ahead and pop it in perfect and now we'll go ahead and we'll fix this in a sec okay i'm not sure exactly what i've done here but uh let's go ahead and carry on i'm gonna carry on with the build and then we'll fix this okay so we have the header container right now the header container is gonna have a bunch of style inside of it but as we mentioned before we have a header left section okay so inside of here i'm gonna have a header left so let's go ahead and say like a header left uh we're gonna have a header right and i'm gonna show you guys what i'm referring to here so imagine our localhost 3000 so this is our actual slack app i'll show you how to do that cool stuff as well we'll say header middle or sort of header search we'll call the middle one all right head to search and then we'll have header right okay header right right now is green not green oh okay really oh wait a sec no that shouldn't be the reason right color green oh dude you're right yeah you're actually right let's go ahead and do that boom there we go and it will actually pop in now so if we go into h1 just save there we go that's correct yeah you're right my bad nice shout daniel good all right so let's go ahead and carry on so there you go you see it applies the style to that div okay so we have three sections over here so what are we referring to at this point header left is going to be the left section we've got the middle section which is going to be the search and then we've got the right section over here so let's go ahead and jump through okay so header left first thing we're going to do is create a const and we're going to say header left so i'm going to go ahead and say const header left like so equals the star div right and remember you if you want a h1 or h2 you can just say style dot h2 and it works in that way as well right so uh that's actually really cool uh are you schmann dude you continue to spam so dude like i'm hiding you from the channel now i've i warned once and then it just continued to continue spam dude so you're out all right so let's go ahead and carry on we've got the header left so we're gonna go ahead and create a header left section over here and this is actually very clean guys because if think about it this way your css is never going to go ahead and overlap okay it's never going to overlap which is amazing if you do it this way whereas css by itself can easily overlap so you have to be careful with that okay now we do we are going to use an avatar here so this top left section over here is an avatar right so this is actually derived from material ui so what i'm going to do is i'm going to import this over here so i'm going to say import avatar from material ui core like so and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to go in here and actually rather than directly using the uh material ui avatar i'm going to make it a start component i'm kind of getting sick of that music so i want my music back on epidemic boom there we go we're gonna have our tunes back there we go it's gonna be a lot of fun now this helps me get into a jam you know that kind of you know a jam state psycho coda what's up dude welcome to the stream man smash the thumbs up button if you're here and you're enjoying it it's going to be a lot of fun today so buckle up and we're going to get into a nice flow at this point okay so header left let's go ahead and build out this left section right so to have a styled avatar right how do we do that so over here i'm going to say const and let's go ahead and say header avatar okay and you can actually name these whatever you want there is no real standard at this point you can define it but what if it's not a default sort of like div or h1 or if it's actually like a custom component right so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to grab the avatar and what i do is i do parentheses avatar right that's how you do it and then i have the double uh quotes all right and then you can make your own styled component out of it which is actually incredibly simple okay so really really easy now random rabbit studio says i actually like putting my style components in its own file good spot so you can right you very easily can move your styled components out of the code base and into their own files in this tutorial i'm going to be building inside of the same file and we're going to be doing that way but i will be introducing a folder structure in this build so good thing you're reminding me dude i'm going to go ahead and say components right and inside the components folder i'm going to grab my header and i'm going to drag it inside now and all of our components except the high level one like app.js and i'm going to update the imports yes let's go ahead and go and save our input import sorry so inside of app.js and now it says components header save make sure when you do that it all works okay i'm going to refresh and let's go ahead and see if we made any mistake okay so it should be all good now at this point and it's compiling there we go okay so at this point the header left right so header avatar sorry inside of header left what i'm going to do is i have a header avatar i'm going to go ahead and pop that in here so i'm going to say header avatar right header avatar and then i'm going to go ahead and it's a self-closing bracket okay so what we're going to do at this point is oh dude i really am getting irritated with these like with these spammy comments dude i see it but if you continue to like send messages i'm just gonna block you okay so at this point um on click right i'm gonna have an on click for this one this is gonna be the sign out but we're gonna do that afterwards i'm gonna say to do and that's the special extension that i'm using there i'm going to say add on click right so we're going to come back to that one and then we're going to say the alternative and the source now the source here would actually be something like the user's picture okay so this is going to be the user's picture as we see here but we're going to go ahead and leave it blank for now okay so it's going to be a blank image for now and then what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to have the time icon so the time icon is this one over here okay so let's carry on let's go ahead and jump over here so i'm gonna go ahead and save at this point and let's see if we see it there we go guys look our first little import perfect okay um and print up don't go ahead and uh you know don't worry just don't acknowledge people who spam that's fine um so at this point we're going to go ahead and leave the header avatar now this the next thing i'm going to do is pop in a icon okay so from material ui so here i'm going to say import access time icon i'm going to go underneath here pop it in there like so now we have our time icon as well which should just jump in in a second there we go guys okay so we have the little icon and i'm going to make this eventually look like this okay so stay tuned and you'll find out how so header left the first thing i want to do is i want to give my header container some styles so how do we do it when we're using styled components it's pretty simple actually we pretty much go here and we just assume that this is regular css inside of this we say display flex and we do our regular sort of things right so we say display flex and this takes normal css rules so at this point we don't see much changing okay so i'm going to go ahead and firstly jump into my header left styles okay so here i'm going to say header left div and inside of here what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and pop in the following styles so we said display flex in here and i want this one to take up a third of the overall screen so i'm going to say effects 0.3 okay then i want this also to be a type display flex i'm going to align the item centrally so i'm going to go ahead and say align item centrally and i'm going to give it a margin left of 20 pixels because i don't want it to touch rich programmer what's up dude frank in the house awesome slack 2.0 bird let's go man thank you so much frank for that clutch donation appreciate you dude all right stormbreaker um redux template is actually extremely easy and if you want to find the easiest thing to use it's recoil we cover it inside the course but yeah recoil is the easiest thing to use guys right so the backticks are for the syntax yes because we actually have some kind of in uh props interpolation some at some points okay now to target this right target this icon so material ui icons by default get the special class and it's called material ui svg icon dash root okay so at this point what i'm going to do is ins if there is ever an icon inside of here right inside the header left so in this case access time icon i'm going to target the icon by doing this and this means inside header left i'm going to target the material ui svg root icon and i'm going to apply a style so here what i'm going to do it's going to say margin left auto and margin right 30 pixels save it and at this point you can see we're starting to get this spacing correct nice okay and the reason why this is good is because we're doing a flex rule so this entire sort of top is flex and then we're saying 0.3 flex so it's only taking up 30 at this point right so this is 30 okay so i shouldn't save that but this is actually 30 at this point right my arrows are a bit dodgy okay so we have a 30 looking you know left side over there which is pretty good so let's go ahead and carry on so you guys can already see it's pretty nice actually to be fair right it's actually pretty nice now what if i want to target that header avatar right so i'm going to go over to the header avatar and i want to make it so that it actually looks like it's a clickable element so firstly i'm going to say okay grab it and say cursor pointer right and then what i'm going to say is when i hover over it so you see how we can apply the styles here it's actually quite a nice syntax right when i hover over i'm going to say the opacity should change to 0.8 okay so when i do this now check this out guys when i hover over this can you see that right that's quite a nice little effect that we have going on over there right finn heart says does zero to full stack hero also talk about how to get clients yes dude we actually talk about that a lot we see zero to full stack hero is not just about building and constantly coding it's about how you go ahead and take those skills and actually land jobs and freelancing clients a lot of coaching calls we talk about people who just had interviews my tips and tricks on how they can approach interviews and every week it's amazing because we can go ahead and have a chat with our with our own sort of you know students inside the course and we can see how their progression goes now what's amazing about that guys and i will carry on in just a sec is that people have got jobs and then we have feedback sessions in the coaching course so really honestly you won't find that anywhere else so it's it's for the community that's why we've done it right uh emerson says it's about the community best ever exactly dude it's all about the community that's exactly what we strive for inside right so for the header container i'm going to go ahead and say position fixed and i'll show you what i'm doing it's a little bit of a hack what i'm doing here but i'm saying position is fixed i want to say a width of 100 and uh this will make a lot of sense later i'm going to align the item centrally and this will come into play in just a sec afterwards line item center and then i'm going to go ahead and say justify the content space between give it a bit of padding so let's go ahead and pop that in save and you can see it should have a little bit of padding at the top now and then i'm going to say the background color remember that css variable that we defined earlier right it has to access it all you need to do is type in var slack color right and remember where we defined this was inside of index.css over here remember slack color we defined the variable here the css variable and here we're using it okay and we're making the color of the text white there we go and that's because these are actually sort of simple bits of text pretty much okay um i use something called screen brush for the the sort of writing on the screen what's up morocco's in the house hey guys we're almost at 300 300 likes let's keep going guys let's keep on going all right so this is looking pretty good right this is looking pretty good at this point now let's go ahead and fix the header search okay so the header search section next priyanshu what's up man good to see you here dude hey header search is an expert okay so over here i'm gonna say okay let's create a header search styled component perfect right and inside the header search we're going to have the search icon so the search icon is actually from material ui so i need to go ahead and import that and you're probably wondering but sunny you just wrote a header search but you never defined it right what is that about and you're right i need to go ahead and define that so i'll go down to the bottom and i'm going to just add it to the top so that way you guys can see i'm gonna say const header search and this is gonna be a style div and you can see look it's not really not that difficult to start getting the hang of it okay so you can go style div and now we can access the stars for it very very simple stuff okay um so perfect stuff now we're going to use pranav i'm not going to use that today but i might use the app bar for material ui in the future build that's a very good cool dude um so at this point i'm going to say header search there we go and i'm going to go ahead and check that we've already got the search icon over there so i'm going to save okay and then let's go ahead and you can see at this point we've got some kind of search icon being pushed over to the right and that makes sense okay and i'll tell you why in a sec so we've got the search icon over here i'm gonna have an input field now this input field is gonna hopefully my emmit kicks in there we go it's gonna be of type text by default it's already typed text we can get rid of that we're going to say the placeholder in this case it's going to be to search the papa fam right because this is going to be like the uh sort of the slack for the papa fam right and also just to mention guys if you didn't already know we have an incredible slack community inside zero tool stack hero first link in the description check it out sale runs out in two days guys then i'm closing the doors to the community so i want to miss out on it honestly second link is actually all of the code as well so you know we're going crazy with sales right now right so at the top of this screen we have the search the pop-up fan right now i want that to look like this and be in the correct position so how do i get it to that point all right i'm going to go over to my header search and what's really cool is if i command click it will actually sort of open up the header search in the styled component location so at this point we have that over here right and then i'm going to go ahead and apply a bunch of styles so this bit took up 0.3 so 30 in the screen i want the middle bit to take up 40 of the screen okay so uh emerson's incredible no it's outstanding that's it jamie davis yo yo what's up man good to see you here i'm going to say flex 0.4 right and guys if you just noticed how quick we're going like it's insane right we get more views and likes than channels with hundreds of thousand subscribers like i think that's incredible i think we should be proud of that as a family man i think the whole papa fam should be proud of that as a team this is not just me this is built from you guys and this is what we're about okay so like let's go ahead and give ourselves like a huge pat on the back for that because honestly the way we're growing the way what is happening it's so damn powerful man so i'm gonna go ahead and give this a border color this is a slight gray color and say text align center and you can start to see guys look there's a slight background being uh being chucked in jamie davis that's a testament to the value providers thank you so much dude really really appreciate that display flex padding naught 50. i'm going to go ahead and check that in here save and you can see it starts to line up okay it's starting to line up and then we're going to say color of gray and a border i'm going to go ahead and chuck in the border and the color gray over here now at this point okay yeah looking okay but i need to target that input field right so the thing i love about start components is we're already inside of header search and inside of header search is an input field which means that we can go ahead and target the input just like that which is a lot simpler right fantana says we are amazing for sure thanks to you sunny appreciate it so much honestly really really appreciate the cameras thank you at this point i'm gonna say the background color of this one is gonna be transparent okay so background color transparent i'm gonna go ahead and get the energy up right now guys because we're about to break 300 likes i think we should step it up a bit let's go guys all right transparent there we go and at this point i'm gonna go ahead and say border none and text align let's change the color up in here as well all right text align center and i'm going to give it a minimum width right min width and i'm going to give this min width to 30 view width save and at this point you can see look at that it perfectly places itself in the way that we expected okay now at this point this looks pretty good but you see we get this that kind of outline now the quick fix to the outline is you simply go ahead and do outline zero or none pretty much i think zero would work yeah there you go zero works nicely and you see the color of the text right we're gonna change that as well i'm just gonna make the color of the text to white there we go save boom all right sunny yeah exactly yeah and there we go okay so at this point what we're gonna do is we have the middle section complete now the reason why it's not being pushed out like this is because we don't have our right section complete so i'm gonna go ahead and create the right section over this point right so christopher asked he says is uh is zero to full stack hero platinum only for a period of time or will it eq include any future courses so christopher just to let you know the offer right now is currently a huge sale we have right now so first link in the description if anyone wants to know about that but if you join now as part of this sale it includes access to all the courses available right now as well as all of the ones listed on the site and that's not going to

thing concept is very cool dude i agree with you all right so um let's carry on guys so here we have this let's go ahead and create the header right okay so header right over here now what we're going to do is we're going to say right like we got oh nice we just got a donation from uncle gatsby 3.99 he says hi sunny do you have any experience with gatsby if so do you have any tutorials on it thank you so much for what you do for us dude i love that thank you so much to answer your question we do we are going to be covering gatsby inside the course uh but we will be covering it okay so just something to be aware of um but in the future hell yeah dude you know me i'm gonna cover all that stuff all right header right okay so this point header right what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go ahead and create header right so you wanna go down to the bottom right so i'm gonna go down to the bottom over here and say const header like this header or right oops and there we go now remember if you oh nice we actually just got sebastian just joined the papa fam dude uh oh no so yeah sorry sebastian donated my bad uh we've got someone else joined the pop up just a second ago a bit confusing about two messages uh there we go let's carry on guys so header right okay so we got header right over here and then inside of header right what i'm gonna have is the simply the help outline icon okay so it's a simple icon on the right hand side so at this point and i love man i love this song i miss coming live honestly let's go help outline this is how you have to cheer yourself up when the sort of tech issues get in the way let's carry on i mean i don't know anywhere else it has this kind of vibe when you occurred honestly like i love it and this is what i thrive on this is what i try and do let's go ahead and get rid of these comments like if you're not having fun when you're coding what are you doing honestly it should be a fun experience right like as in obviously it gets it gets painful i'm not gonna lie right it gets painful right faizan we have react basics and web dev essentials being released nice i recommend anyone to join platinum platinum is my recommendation for anyone to jump in we have the cell ending in two days platinum is the one platinum is lifetime dude like don't waste your money on this membership the monthly ones just do platinum get lifetime and you're done and then you'll be part of the community for everything right which is crazy muhammad says sending your vibe is unstoppable that's what i'm talking about guys all right the music is actually part of my epidemic sounds playlist so i'm going to go ahead and fix this one above says looking fresh thank you dude all right now let's go ahead and finish off styling the header right let's go ahead and do that so over here hello right perfect jump down here to style head around we're going to say the final bit should be a flex 0.3 because think about it guys this was 0.3 which is 30 this is 0.4 which is 40 and i want the final one to be 0.3 that means it'll be perfectly sort of positioned around right vocal the first link in the description to go ahead and check it all out we're gonna say flex 0.3 there we go and i'm going to go ahead and say display flex there we go let's save and now you can see look at that guys looks really really clean right now okay and i'm going to actually align the items flex end so that way it sticks to the right and if you ever get tempted to go ahead and do something like float i will personally come to you and slap you so don't use hello anymore guys it's old it's it's gone don't do it all right don't do that stuff let's carry on all right so at this point i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to target the material you uh the material ui icon okay so at this point i'm going to say a material eye icon like this and inside of here i'm going to do margin left of auto margin right 20 pixels right there we go sanjay loved that one so guys look at that that looks pretty fresh right look at that boom i don't even see a difference man look at that no flicker except the little icon we will fix that okay so flexbox is clean like if you learn how to use flexbox you're gonna kill it four likes away from 300 likes let's smash that like button and go forward guys let's keep on going strong right so at this point what i'm going to do is let's go ahead and build the sidebar perhaps right so i think we're done with that yep we're done with that and guys look this is just an example of how powerful starred components is like look how clean this is boom look at that and the css is just down in you can move this into a separate component if you want i would recommend saying header.style.js if you're going to do it okay that'll be my recommendation we have 305 likes thank you so much guys just keep on going i love it just bring me back to life after that little tech issue let's just kill it guys let's kill it right so next thing i want to do is that sidebar right so i'm going to jump back over to app.js and you're going to see that we actually have a very clean build today okay so the next part right the entire app what i'm going to assume is that this bit over here so all of this is actually going to be something like an app body okay so this whole thing is going to be like the app body right and then the header is always going to show right that's how we're going to kind of build this out all right so at this point what i want to do is i'm going to have the header over here and what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to take the header outside the switch right so the header should always be present here and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to have app body right and app body is going to have everything inside and it's all going to be determined by a switch okay now at this point um what we're going to do is i'm actually change this build up a little bit so we might actually not need to over complicate this but eventually what we're going to have is a chat inside of here this is going to be a chat component okay and we will make it look super clean super nice now app body what is that right so we need to go ahead and define it so here i'm going to say constant body equals a styled div all right star div and there we go backticks and then what is this float that you talk about so if you don't know what float is then just just don't worry about it just pretend you didn't hear anything all right so says forget it exists you shouldn't be using float anymore it's just it's an old way of handling things okay so i'm going to go to the top and i'm going to go ahead and do boom import start from style components save right and go ahead and refresh there we go okay so we have the app body now what i can do with this app body is i can start defining styles or of everything that goes underneath there okay so inside of there all i'm going to have is actually before we go ahead and finish that bit i'm going to have something called a sidebar okay so over here i'm actually going to have a sidebar component so here i'll say oops i'm going to say sidebar and this will be responsible for this sidebar that you see right here okay so that's going to be the sidebar over there now at this point what i'm going to do is um right uh my name's sunny dude vibe uh all right so let's carry on so i'm going to go ahead and create a sidebar component so i'm going to go ahead and pop it in here so i'm going to create i'm going to go into my components folder create sidebar dot js okay and i'm going to say rfce right for a react functional component with an export right now over inside the sidebar let's go ahead and start coding this up all right so the first thing i want to do is create a sidebar container so this one i'm going to change it to a sidebar container now over here i'm going to say con sidebar container equals a style div all right so it's going to be our surrounding container outside the application go ahead and pop that down like so now at this point i need to make sure i ins import react start components like this okay now guys we are going to break 400 likes i'm telling you this keep on pushing this energy i love it i really can't believe it like how small are sort of not even small guys 22 000 followers like subscribers right now but we just continue to break like what is expected from a channel with 22k subs right let's keep on getting those likes up and let's just kill it let's just keep on going man that's the show the whole world were about this is crazy all right sidebar container over here right now the sidebar has a few areas it has a header and then it has a few extra bits down here these are all called sidebar option components and we're going to go ahead and build them out okay so i'm going to go ahead and show you how to do that uh today now the sidebar header right so let's go ahead and focus on this header section over here okay so um what we're going to do now is create a sidebar header so i'm going to go ahead and say okay sidebar header and then i need to create that so i'm going to say cons type by header equals a star div start div there we go and save right so now we have our sidebar header over here now inside what goes inside the sidebar header so i actually have two sections here i have a left section which i'm going to refer to as sidebar info okay and then i have i'm going to inside of here i'm going to have a h2 and a h3 okay so over here what i'm going to do is create another one called sidebar info i'm going to say sidebar info like so and i'm going to go ahead and create this then a quick way of doing this is boom and then you can go ahead and rename this one to sidebar info like so okay now inside of here i'm gonna have a h2 which says uh pop-up from hq okay so this is gonna refer to this bit over here now underneath that i'm gonna have a h3 and inside the h3 i'm gonna firstly have this little drawing icon right and this is actually got a weird name to it right it's called fiber manual record icon now god knows why it's called that but it is what it is okay so it is what it is right and we're all we're literally climbing on those likes guys let's keep it coming for fiber manual icon so i'm gonna go ahead and import that from material ui like so perfect now underneath right i'm gonna go ahead and have oh dude i think we just got chris oh welcome chris just joined the uh papa platinum dude dude welcome man welcome to the proper fun guys any we've got loads of members in the paparam right now welcome christopher he just jumped in the sale is the first link in the description guys he joined he made the right decision purple platinum welcome dude that's amazing right so now we have the h3 over here dude that just made me pumped up man and then we're going to have the user's name so in this case what i'm going to say is i'm just going to say sunny sangha for now and then when we log in i'm actually going to pull that record from it okay jacob says sonny you are my hero dude you are my hero for watching so thank you so much man all right now i'm gonna go ahead and import the sidebar into our app.js so over here i'm gonna say app.js and i'm gonna go ahead and import this right boom import save right i'm gonna go ahead fontana that's fire dude hell yeah man all right the fan grows man says you're right that's it dude we just keep on growing man all right so at this point how do we go ahead and get this to look the way we need it so we have the sidebar over here okay and what i want to just double check is that okay so firstly app body let's go ahead and style this in a way that we need to okay so i'm going to go ahead and first when we have the sidebar body i'm going to say this is display flex and it has a height of 100 view height okay because i want to use up the entire height save like so i'm going to refresh and you can still you can't see anything right now okay i'm going to fix that in just a second i think that might be because we haven't actually saved this properly there we go and you can see we will fix that in just a sec let's go back to app.js over here now what i'm going to do is i'm going to make sure all right so we've got the sidebar here perfect from component sidebar and let's just double check right now we've got the proper farm like so it's most likely the color at this point so we'll go ahead and fix that out so i'm going to jump into my sidebar and when we have the sidebar container i'm going to style that one right now so cyborg container style div and this one is going to be a color white but the background color is going to be the slack color okay so the first thing we'll do is say background color variable slack color and there you go right that's how we do it um looks fresh okay so uh faizan i will be dropping react native dude don't worry um right an expo you should be using expo dude if you are working on it until you need anything else but we got color white there we go and then what i'm going to say is a flex of 0.3 because i want the sidebar to only take up 30 so here we're going to say flex of 0.3 and then you can see now it's taking up 0.3 okay and then what i'm going to say is a border top of one pixel solid right and i'm going to say a margin top of 60 pixels now there is a little trick i've done here okay and what i've done here is i've actually gone ahead and made this fix and there's a reason why because later on i do this little cool trick and now with a margin top of 60 pixels it shows okay and there's a reason why because if you notice in the final build if we have a long bit of text right and we do this say hello world let's just type in hello world you see how it scrolls down it's a little trick that we're doing to keep the top it where it is okay so thank you so much great energy appreciated dude so let's carry on so at this point let's keep going and we're going to have a bunch of horizontal rows and we're going to target that in a sec but we'll leave it for now so at this point how do i get this to look like this okay because it did they definitely don't look like that right now um what we need to do is i'm gonna go ahead and firstly next to the sidebar info i'm gonna get that icon so it's called the create icon and we need to import that from material ui so i need to go to the top and say import create icon from material ui save now refresh and we should be able to see the little pencil okay so let's go ahead and make this um look in the exact way we need to like this one over here because that looks clean that looks ugly okay we want to make it look a lot better okay so here what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go ahead and say let me turn my mic gain down there we go i'm going to say cyborg container and we've already started this one out the next one we do sidebar header okay so for the sidebar header i'm going to simply go ahead and jump over to my my start component where is it down here and i'm going to give this one the following we'll say display flex and it's going to have a border bottom so let me go ahead and just grab this i'm going to say display flex or the bottom padding bottom and a padding around it okay there we go let's just chuck that in and this actually eradicates this one so we can go ahead and get rid of that and you can see now it's somewhat got a similar structure but the text isn't the same okay now we have an icon here this one right now display flex made it into a row which is why this is now on the right of this okay if you guys know peter mckinnon you'll know what this song is about right this is where it's about it's where it's from um so i'm gonna do material ui svg so i'm gonna target the inner material ui icon and then in here i'm gonna give this icon a padding of 8 pixels a color a font size a border radius so it has a nice little circle behind it and a background color of white and we should with these rules get it to look like this let's go ahead and give that a try boom save kapow there we go looks good right i like that i think that looks really nice the next thing i want to do is we have sidebar info now sidebar info is this bit i want this to essentially look like this okay so let's go ahead and make it that way okay so we will have redox inside of zero to full stack hero dude so we have a sale on right now first link in the description make sure you you capitalize on that because it's gonna the doors are gonna close after that man i can't i can't even say it enough all right so i'm going to go over to the sidebar info and i'm going to start this one i'm going to say flex 1 right flex on that and then here we're going to say h2 and then i'm going to go ahead and say here i want a font size of 15 pixels font weight of 900 and a margin bottom of 5 pixels okay so let's go ahead and do this save right so uh faizan dude again i do want everyone man i do want everyone to say like don't spam david says sonny can you include things like formic yes i actually did do that inside of my gmail clone um so you can check no did i didn't use formic but i used um i used react hooks form which has validation inside of it so if you're interested in that dude david check out my gmail clone the original gmail clone all right let's go say h3 i don't care i built that it's gonna say display flex and then what we're gonna do is say font size 13 font size 13 um and i would say font weight to 400 a line item center right so let's go ahead and do this boom there we go save and then oh man's in the house what's up babe my gorgeous girlfriend's in the house and yeah i actually had a bad issue but we're back now okay so i'm going to target this is the thing that i like by the way so i have a h3 tag and if you see over here i have a h3 and inside of it i have that material ui icon okay so usually you have to do some janky weird stuff in css right but this is pretty clean taran please don't spam dude all right so here what i'm going to say is target the h3 see you later gwen and i'm going to target the material ui svg root icon go ahead and grab that and then here i'm gonna go ahead and have the font size uh i'm gonna go ahead and one size 14 margin top one pixel margin right two pixels and a color of green and you'll notice that this will suddenly change into a beautiful looking icon and it'll have that sort of you know that signed in look and feel to it okay so that's exactly what i wanted right there right now if you notice look at that looks pretty damn good to me okay now the reason why this is a little bit different is because we have this chat component on the right but we will get there okay we're going to get to that point guys let's hit 400 likes if you're watching right now and you haven't smashed the thumbs up button smash it because it's going to help this video get to as many people as possible with that said quick wall break what's up rishi he's watching on um richie lola laura sorry dude i always get it wrong uh he's watching on twitch let's carry on okay so at this point i'm gonna go ahead and have over here we have the create icon so the sidebar header is essentially complete okay so we have the header which is essentially complete now down here we're gonna have a reusable component and we're gonna call this one this sidebar option okay it's a sidebar option so i already have my coffee thank you so much dude um so cyber option so i'm gonna go ahead and create that right now so i'm gonna open up my code go into my components folder and you can see your site look pretty clean okay let's say sidebar option.js i'm gonna hide that rfce boom right let's go ahead whoa nigeria in the house what's up man and then here again you can see like you start getting into a flow of it right i'm going to say cons sidebar option container and we'll say equal style div my style diff and you just want to go ahead and get you know like that muscle memory up i always say like it's not you don't have to be the best coder you just need to get that pattern recognition and you slowly figure things out guys i don't remember everything off the top of my head i don't think i don't i really don't expect any developer to but you want to go ahead and make sure you just take the time to ingrain that muscle memory okay like because it does make a difference okay it's very important um practice will lead to that okay so at this point we have our sidebar over here now what we're gonna do is have a bunch of these sidebars now these are gonna have two props okay i want to pass in a prop which is the icon itself and i want to pass in the title which is going to be like this the title mentions and reactions and so forth and each individual icon now what i've actually done here is i'll show you how i want this to look so let's assume i had all of these right in so inside my code so just to save some time i've actually gone ahead and imported those already now in react you can have each component can take props right now props are properties they allow um dax says it's gonna be recorded yes dude it's gonna be recorded um and it will allow a component to render with slight differences based on the properties that you pass in okay so at this point let's go ahead and paste right so i've got this right here and you guys can see that we've just got a bunch of these and each one is getting a different icon and it's getting a different title now i will show you how to consume that in just a sec but let's go ahead and first import all of those icons as necessary okay so it's going to be from the to all the way to expand all right i'm going to go ahead and grab a bunch of icons and import them okay so you can pause the video there watch it if you need to get those icons now at this point what we should see is cyborg option is not defined okay so obviously it makes sense right we need to go to cyber option hit save and then i need to go to sidebar and go ahead and do my little go to the end of the component control spacebar and there we go and let's see the second one is a source component sidebar option that actually does an auto import trick okay ayman says fire bro thank you so much dude appreciate you watching let's go ahead and do that now you can see look it loads right now nothing's on the screen so we're gonna go ahead and make sure something actually shows up on the screen okay guys just hit 400 likes come on we can do it i know it we can keep pushing this stuff right so what we're going to do is we have the icon then we have the title thread so in this case what i want to do here is i want to actually consume this as something called props like i mentioned before so perhaps comes through as a simple function argument okay so at this point what i want to do is i'm going to go ahead and do i'm going to destructure which means i'm essentially going to go ahead and tear apart right i'm going to basically go ahead and tear apart the object okay so i'm going to go ahead and pull apart the object at this point i'm going to pull the icon out and the title this is called destructuring okay uh robert there is actually all the code inside the github repo um but we need to kind of move a little faster than this one so uh let's carry on dude so at this point um rather than sidebar container a sidebar option actually that's good we can keep it as that okay so i'm gonna go ahead and jump in right so now at this point what i'm also going to do is there we go that's fine actually we've got icon and title so you can see we're actually passing in a whole icon here right so and that's the reason why this is a capital i not a lowercase i because we're going to be rendering it on the screen in just a sec now inside of here right what i'm going to do is i'm going to have a few things in there so i'm going to say okay if you passed in an icon right so we're going to protect ourselves then i'm going to render the icon out okay it's a self-closing component and all of these icons in material ui take your font size and then we can give that font size of small okay now here i'm actually going to give it an inline style because it's a bit hard to do a uh a styled component in that use case so i'm going to say just give it a padding of 10 for each of these right so there we go now at this point you can see all the icons have just popped in so it's looking pretty good at this point right so and the reason why i put icon and and is because you might actually render the component now without passing in an icon okay so the second thing i'm gonna say is okay if you pass the icon then what i'm gonna say is i'm gonna go ahead and render a h3 which has the title okay so here i'm gonna say okay jsx with the squiggly brackets i'm to say title like this and here is we're using a ternary operator so this basically means if if icon is truthy so if it's true or if it has a value inside of it render this out otherwise render out what's ever in this side of in this parenthesis so at this point what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go ahead and create a sidebar option channel um div okay so this is actually gonna be a start component and i'm gonna create this over here so i'm gonna copy that i'm gonna go ahead and grab this line and then i'm also gonna go ahead and boom there we go cyber option channel there we go now at this point we have this div star div there and i'm just gonna span a hashtag here right i'm going to span a hashtag and i'm going to have the title over here and there's a reason why we're doing this now it'll make a lot of sense in just a sec okay so i'm going to go ahead and hit save code with yug says awesome build please call out my name yeah i got you dude guys 180 people watching this is huge right now we actually have 200 across all the platforms smash that thumbs up button please if you're enjoying this because it's going to help the video help more people and that's what we do in the papa fam if you're interested in joining first link in the description sale ends in two days and i'm closing the doors for that yeah that's how it is abhishek what's up dude all right so at this point you can see look this is how it's looking right i don't want it to look like this i want to look a little bit cleaner than this so how do i style it to look in that way so i'm going to go to the sidebar option container and the first thing we'll say is display flex now i do want to see my code so i'm going to go ahead and make it like this i'm going to say display flex okay save and you can see everything goes into a row okay hey maven's here she goes yes guys hold on sunny sunny let's go for food after yeah honestly i got the headache this gave me that one called me up and i gave her i was a bit grumpy because uh you know the the stream cut but thank you babe for always sticking in right so at this point i will say display flex font size of 12 pixels and then i'm going to say align items center okay line item center padding left of two pixels a padding left of two pixels all right so two pixels like this and then i'm going to say a cursor point now because i want all of these to be like somewhat sort of as you hover over it right you can say sorry i'm sorry okay there we go i'm sorry for being grumpy papa react is kind of grumpy at times guys so there you go all right i'm going to say okay when i hover over it i want to change the opacity right so in order to do that what i do is i i that's it i'm now she's taking the neck all right so opacity 0.9 i'm going to change the background color when i hover over it okay so let's go ahead and refresh and then you see that guys look at that fresh okay look at that looks good pretty clean now you can see over here look we're almost there and it's looking pretty good at this point okay so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna target the h3 right now the h3 sits over here okay so in order to grab it again start components makes it so easy you can say h3 grab it i'm going to say a font weight because i want to reduce the boldness of that text i'm going to say it should be a 500 sort of weight okay so 500 is somewhat of an average rate you can see it drops the font size a little bit more okay so after we've done the h3 i'm going to jump into the h3 and and i'm going to jump into a span tag and as you can remember over here we had a span for the hashtag there's a reason why i spam the hashtag it's because i only want to style the that one hashtag right i just want to go ahead uh and yeah all right so now i see uh augustine says wow the engine this platform is mad exactly dude that's all we're about honestly it's just you know we just have fun here man padding of 15 pixels okay that's it and uh and we code right we code properly that's how we do it right so look at that that looks clean man i like that that looks pretty good so at this point what we're gonna do is i'm gonna go back up to my code and now we have this reusable component okay so it looks pretty good at this point um what was very useful about this is that we actually made it so that if we don't pass an icon in we can just use the we can just render our title now why is that handy because if you wanted to have it like you can pretty much have it as just like channels without an icon so it's a nice way of doing it okay so what we can do is i'm gonna go back to sidebar and over here so i'm gonna go ahead and make that bit smaller so you guys can see it there we go over here what i'm gonna say is where we have sidebar option michael what's up dude michael actually won uh a prize inside of um i think it was a second place michael so congrats dude inside the netflix challenge absolutely smashed it did so here i'm gonna drop horizontal lines okay so you see over in this build we have the horizontal lines coming in clutch over here and here so i'm going to go ahead and do the same thing over in our build okay so i'm going to say horizontal line and then you can see over here it just looks pretty ugly at that point but we'll style it right we'll make a little better and then i'm gonna have another cyber option okay so i don't know why that jumped over there we have another cyber option with the expand more icon and the title is going to be channels and this is what the beauty right this is the real beauty of the um this is the beauty of style component of reusable components okay and style components i guess because we're using both of them but it's really really clean because reasonable components like if you do them well you can code so fast right because you don't have to repeat yourself it also makes it a lot easier to maintain your code base okay so this is really good guys come on almost at 400 likes let's go all right so i'm going to drop another horizontal row over here so boom we should have another line and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to have an add icon channel right so here i'm going to have another add icon and this has another prop called add channel option okay and i'll show you what we do with that one in just a sec but if i go ahead and save that now it's going to freak out because we didn't import ad icon so i'm going to go ahead and pull in add icon from material ui like so save and then what i'm going to do is refresh and you can see that the go here would be all of these buttons are actually clickable right so i can click them and all that sort of stuff and then this one if i click it it says please enter a channel name so we want some functionality behind it how do i determine when to sort of pop this up i pass another prop and you guessed it that prop is gonna be the add channel option so if i go over to sidebar option i'm gonna pull that in as a prop okay and we'll sort of set that up in just a sec okay perfect now at this point right we have the channels over here and then we have the final bit underneath now the last bit is actually the channels which render out so if i was to go ahead and add a channel saying um let's just say let's just say pop fam all right just to say pop fam okay and you can see like a channel came in here so this one we need to go ahead and actually sort of set up with a database behind it okay so this is actually sort of uh oh nice classes guys come on energy from twitch nice um yeah so you can you see this is gonna be set up to a database we're gonna go ahead and configure that in just a sec okay so what i'm gonna do at this point is i'm going to go ahead and style out the hr right so i'm going to go into my sidebar over here and i'm going to go ahead and say start bar sorry sidebar container and i'm going to target the horizontal row which is that line and i'm going to give it a margin top 10 pixels margin bottom and a border of one pixel solid and it's got a nice little color to it you guys will see in just a sec boom there we go very subtle okay very very subtle stuff and then what we're gonna do is the we've already done the header we've already done that blah blah blah nice that actually looks pretty damn good okay so at this point if i go ahead and show you guys look at this that's pretty damn close right so we're looking pretty good at this point okay now what we want to do is i actually want to firstly create these rooms okay so how do we create the rooms right so oh nice london uk oh i'm in london dude right so uh let's go ahead and say at this point boom just go and pop this halfway put this halfway nice okay so inside of sidebar option what i'm going to do is i'm going to have a add channel now what's really cool here is that i'm going to basically have it so that if you click on this one you add a channel if you click on this one you're selecting a channel okay so in this case if i if i click on this one it selects the channel okay it takes a little second because the internet's a bit slow but if i go ahead and for example add the channel how do i do that right how do i make it sort of dependent on on that sort of thing so the way i do that is i go ahead let me just make this small for a sec and then we make this a bit bigger so we go ahead we take our add channel option prop now we go to our sidebar option container and what i simply do is i say okay attach an on click right uh but if i have add channel option passed as a prop i'm going to trigger off the add channel function which we need to write or if that's actually not there we don't actually see this prop in there or it's falsies so which means it's not got a value behind it i want to select a channel instead now these two functions i need to create add channel and select channel okay so almost at 400 likes guys smash the thumbs up button we're almost almost there okay now at this point i'm going to create two functions we're going to create one which is const add channel and this is gonna be an anonymous function i'm gonna do the same thing for select channel i'm gonna say con select channel boom an anonymous function like so that's it right we've got two two different functions over there and uh yeah you shouldn't have any errors inside your code at this point everything should be looking good 400 likes literally one like away come on guys let's do it literally we're almost up flipping 500 likes and we literally lost 200 from a technical glitch that's what i'm talking about guys thank you so much we just hit 400 likes incredible stuff incredible incredible stuff that's what the proper fans about just want to say one more time sell ends in two days to join the pop fam god damn guys don't miss out first link in the description christopher made the choice today to join us and he will not regret it dude that's what i'm talking about i love how you know you wait for that one like and then it's like boom 10 likes right that's what i'm talking about that's the kind of energy we need dude like where was those where were those people they're just like waiting on standby like i'm gonna i'm gonna be that person that gets one and then everyone decides to jump and it's like boom you know how it is all right all right let's carry on guys so at this point we have got the ad channel okay so for the ad channel we're gonna do a few cool things and now what i need to do is set up firebase okay so i'm gonna go over to my files earlier remember we added in the firebase configuration okay so what i actually need to do is command j pull out my terminal i'm gonna say yarn add firebase all right so yes because we're going to install firebase into our project now while it's doing that i can go over here and i can say import firebase from firebase mahmed says hey sony great work man thank you so much dude shrika let's do it dude let's get 500 i think we can do it right now what we're going to say is while that's installing i already know it's right we're going to say firebase app equals firebase which is our package we just installed dot initialize app and the way you set up the app and basically what this is doing is it connects the the front end that we're building right now to firebase so firebase is the thing that's powering everything it's google's sort of backend servers and basically right now it initialized app is gonna take that configuration and connect these two things together all right and it makes everything work in the way we expect so here i'm going to say firebase config okay and then i'm going to go ahead and say const db because i need access to the database now what database am i referring to guys you might be wondering so i'm going to go over to my firebase i'm going to go into over here and i'm going to say cloud firestore okay so cloud firestore over here victor uh newbleen says you deserve 1 million for subscribers dude we're not going to stop until we get there so i'm telling you just keep on going right next right now let's go ahead and hit 500 likes that's the sort of you know we celebrate all this morning you want to click on create database start in test mode click next here you want to click name enable that's fine all good right so once that's done this will go ahead and set up firestore right firestore is a real-time database now it's so powerful it's real-time which means as messages come through it'll be so easy to implement we're gonna go ahead and do it really nicely right now okay so it says cannot enable after you set it though oh interesting let's have a look why i might actually have to use if it if you can't enable it i'll i'll go ahead and use a different account that's completely cool all right so setting up security rules what's up with that okay it did that so if you get that error just go ahead and do it all right so at this point what i'm gonna do is uh and guys this is not a gossip channel dude so please don't all right so what we're gonna do is we're going to go ahead and this is basically a nosql structure right now what does a nosql structure look like right nosql pretty much has a structure of collection right and a collection can have several documents okay so it'll have several documents now if you don't know about this stuff i really recommend you look into what nosql databases are like and then after a document like you'll have several documents so imagine our collection was let's say rooms right so chat rooms okay every single document would represent a different room like a different chat room okay now each room will have its own collections you see it takes a collection document collection structure so this one would be a collection and then in here you would have a collection of messages right so this one would be like for example would be a collection of messages and then this would lead to a literally again so it would lead to all the messages in the form of document like documents okay so here you would have all the different messages for this chat room so you see you have a collection of rooms the rooms themselves each room will have its own collection of messages and then these will be rendered out as documents okay so that's how it kind of works when you're using nosql okay so at this point what we're gonna do black knight says just finished netflix day three challenge i came here for the new build that's what i'm talking about dude coming in clutch man so at this point we've got the database how do i access it okay i say firebase app i basically grab this pastex i'm lazy and then i say dot firestore right no no i don't i say firebase app yeah dot five store yeah i do almost got lost there right and then i'm gonna say const auth because we have a sign in in this app so i'm gonna say firebase.org and this is how we do it now how do i get google authentication right what i do is i add in something called a provider now all you need to do is add in this line right here and what this does is it gets the google authentication provider which is that nice little pop-up ready for us okay so what i do now is i go over to my firebase and i go to authentication the tab over here click it all right this is insane right that's what i'm saying guys honestly like the power of the papa phone we have literally uh 170 people watching across different platforms right now and we have 421 likes like that's just that just shows you how powerful this damn community is right like it's incredible like i don't see any other channel doing this right now authentication click get started and then here very simple to get this up and running okay what you want to do is you want to go to google hit this button enable and then you want to click on a project support email save that's how you enable google authentication guys it's literally that simple i promise you and it's even easier now because we're using firebase hooks and they're going to be your best friend i swear to god guys let's hit 500 likes come on it's going to be so fun all right so we've got this right up now running okay so this looks pretty good and what i'm going to do now is i need to export this stuff so that we can use it outside so i'm going to say export and i'm going to export explicitly i'm going to say export the authentication the provider and the db this means that i can access the db from anywhere i can access the authentication and i can access a little pop-up anywhere okay so this is gonna be uh really important work says i learned more from sunny than in university dude that's what i'm talking about man that's what i wanna do you know that's my mission to just drive a value right let's get this energy back up quick water break if you guys are having a water break then uh join me right now and let's let's have it together sounded weird but you know [Music] all right change the lighting a little bit change a little tempo to this right let's carry on guys okay so at this point we're going to go ahead and jump into our sidebar option okay say to say teacher t break four access nice red bull break oh i don't know it's dangerous for me dude six o'clock i i do want to sleep tonight all right so at this point what we're gonna do is i'm gonna actually add in so firstly we're gonna do the ad channel now how do we add a channel to that database structure that i showed you earlier before we actually do that i want to add i want to show you guys a little trick okay so if you go to rules over here now don't do this in production environments this is only for demos or something on your portfolio that don't really matter but i'm going to make it so that anyone can read and write to this database you shouldn't do that for production okay if you should only have it and i'm not gonna go into the security rules right now but it's very important that you don't do that in production environments let's go ahead and go back to data so how do i go ahead and add rooms right so what rooms am i talking about exactly i'm talking about these rooms so like youtube papa fam papa how do you get all these different channels right and eventually if you guys stick it to the end you will be able to actually go ahead and jump onto the chat and we can all have a chat through the app which would be pretty cool okay fantanus is still in love with that water bottle honestly dude i love this water bottle i have so many of these um so i'm gonna say add channel and then here what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna say okay what i'm gonna do is i'll say const channel name and how do i get the channel name right what i'm going to do is i'm going to say prompt okay so i'm actually going to prompt the user and that's actually built in so we can say please enter the channel name right so please enter the channel name okay now what you want to do is whenever you prompt the user you need to protect against the empty so some people might go ahead and prompt but then go ahead and enter it without value or you want to protect against that uh this is a pre this is a more upgraded version of the previous slack clone yes so here we say if and then we say channel name right if channel name and if the channel name has a value then we access the database because basically remember that firebase that we the configuration we set up earlier and we exported it so i'm going to pull in my database and i'm just going to say and i'm importing it from my local firebase file i'm going to say db dot collection and the collection is going to be the rooms and what i'm going to do is i'm going to add a room okay find heart thank you so much dude i'm going to add a room and they're basically adding a room so it's very simple you add an object right you just simply go ahead and pop in the name of this room is going to be the channel name that i just collected from the prompt now let's go ahead and see this in action over on the other one so if we go ahead and say add a channel and yeah you can see if i say like let's just say uh coding enter you can see coding right so how do i go ahead and do that so i'm going to say channel name and hit save now on our build over here if i go ahead and hit add channel and i need to refresh most likely and what we actually need to do is in sidebar add channel option i passed it through we pass in over here there we go and if i go ahead and click add channel now please enter the channel name so if i say abc emerson says most friendly guy ever thank you so much guys uh well it's literally nearly up 450 likes let's go man let's get okay perfect okay so it worked in the way we expected it to but nothing really happened alright saita just said suddenly i got five jobs wow oh my god dude just send me brew for that please tell me on my instagram i don't know why is i love this damn song man all right so now we pretty much go ahead and have a nice little prompt at this point okay all right so 450 likes let's go man oh my god this channel was insane honestly let's go all right so this will go ahead and add it now i actually just went ahead and tried that out so let's see if i added it to there but so i'm going to hit refresh on the cloud firestore database we should see rooms rooms there we go and we see abc that was the room that we just created right awesome stuff so we actually went ahead and pushed it into our back end okay so that looks really really nice at this point in time now how do i actually go ahead and then list them out on the sidebar though right so it's all farewell that we add them but how do i actually use them now previously we had to use some kind of janky's effect and if you've ever seen any of my builds it was kind of a headache to do that okay so instead what we're going to be doing now because what i want to do is i want to have a real-time listener to that database which will allow me to basically pull this in in a real-time fashion okay so what i'm going to do here is uh oh nice shazamed it thank you dude so what i'm going to do here is i'm actually going to go ahead and say um firebase hooks and save and you can see react firebase hooks right you're going to click the first link and all you need to do to get this up and running you guys can feel free to read that documentation but all i'm going to do is go ahead and command j yarn add react firebase hooks so i'm going to install this okay and this is the one that you want to install now they have a really great documentation there and here's the sort of useful links that show you how to use each one so the authentication has cloud files to hooks but you guys are going to see the absolute crazy power okay you're going to see honestly the crazy power of this right now so it's already installed so we hit command j to hide it and now what we do is we go to the top of our file where we typically would have you know defined some state right but what we do here is we say const we want the channels from firestore okay so something i don't really see what you're doing here so we're going to get the channels and what's actually even better we can get the loading state even when it's loading and if there's an error we can actually get the error state right so this is getting this is kind of getting powerful saying what are you doing here right and then here we say equals use collection okay views collection and some of you watching like i'm listening i'm kind of listening where's this happening and let's go ahead and import that right from the react firebase hooks and then how do we go ahead and access the collection so i'm actually going to go ahead and access this collection right now and i'm trying to get the channels right which is actually the rooms right so in this case the naming's a bit off but that's what we're referring to madhu says you have a lot of energy man thank you so much dude you guys give me that energy and here what i do is i say db right so i'm going to go ahead and pull in my db which i already have and i'm saying db.collection and i'm just going to point to the rooms and you better god down believe it that that is it now in channels i have the collections so if i go ahead and i just say let's just do a console log of channels here and i go ahead and i do f command f12 to show this look at this guys that is actually that's actually the uh the channels right there so if i do docs an array of one and it looks so weird right now but i'll show you that i'll prove to you that that is actually what we're looking for right so this isn't this is incredible all right this is really really incredible uh finna says it's been an hour you nearly finished it you went out at a pace and made me understand thanks a lot thank you so much man honestly like i really appreciate the kind words um surendra recognize me bro right so let's carry on um [Music] and what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and get rid of that console log and i'm going to go ahead and say so we have the channels over there right now i want to loop through them and show them as sidebar options okay so how do i do that what i want to do is each actual sort of room has an id as well so i will be passing that as in another additional prop to my sidebar option but what i need to do here is go back to sidebar and i'm going to go over here and i'm going to say okay go into the channels right go into the docs and remember channels can be undefined in the beginning so we're going to protect it with something called optional chaining right then we say dot right how are using react.js without having stack overflow in the next page real programmer respect thank you dude honestly just practice takes a lot of practice and uh my course right obviously take it you understand react inside out right there's a sale one by the way guys two days left first link in description check it out if you're interested right here we're gonna say uh channels.docs.map okay uh so all the audiences sees i'm sorry i didn't pronounce it right through them yes i'm gonna map through them dude so i'm gonna go ahead and say map for each one and each of the documents what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and return something so what i want to do is i want to return through this entire list and basically render out a sidebar option so i'm going to go ahead and pop a cyber option now obviously i don't want this one i actually just wanted the i don't want the icon here what i want instead is i want to say okay the title should be the doc dot data so i'm going to access the data which is this data inside of a document and i'm going to say dot name which was actually the name that i gave it here so dot name right so little typo dot name okay that's the first thing now whenever you have a map inside of react you should always provide a key right now keys are very important because it tells you react that you do not need to re-render that entire list if something gets added in because let's say it rendered a thousand elements in the list and you only want to you only add in one extra sort of element to that list because every single one has a different key now react knows oh wait a sec you only added something at the bottom the other 52 that you added before don't need to be re-rendered so it makes it a lot more efficient okay so here i say the key is dot doc id right and the document id is going to be this one so at this point what can i do i can say actually i'm going to pass through an id which is going to be the doctor id because i actually need this id as a prop and i'll show you why okay i'll show you exactly why channels is not defined that's because um oh wait a sec in sidebar options um oh i've done it in the wrong room there we go this needs to be inside bar my bad so this should be inside bar right now there we go inside bar and then this means that the use collection should also be inside bar okay so this one should also be in here which means we also need to import db so make sure you just follow me with that one as a slight little change it should be in sidebar okay harpery what's up man good to see you bro uh that's my brother-in-law's that's just here's my brother in the house there we go all right and then here we're gonna say channels there we go and you got the channels it says channels is not defined but if we save now when we refresh should be good right so now you can see like the channels but ah there you go guys abc there we go look at that works right i mean it looks like trash but we'll make it look nice um so at this point like it does not look great but we're going to make that look a little bit better we're going to make that look very clean in the end okay so how do i get this to look in the way that i have option so i'm heading over to sidebar option i'm passing through the id okay so make sure you don't forget that step is very important now inside the sidebar option okay uh that's it harps is in the house man so what we're gonna do is where we have the h3 okay so this is going to be the sidebar option channel so we need to style cyber option channel which is why it looks like trash right now so i'm gonna go over to sidebar option channel and where is that sidebar option channel there we go okay so this is gonna be a sli this is not gonna be a div it's gonna be a h3 okay because this is going to be an a sort of h3 so you see what we're doing there it's really good right actually says hey son you just joined you are amazing thank you so much dude uh hardik says you're on fire thank you man we're literally about to break 500 likes come on guys just keep on going it's so so cool and i love how everyone chats to each other starts to get to know each other so nice all right so here i'm going to say padding of 10 pixels by zero so 10 pixels by zero i'm going to say a font weight of 300. whoa check out ancho sing he says i have landed a 100k job thank you that's it man that's what we do that's what we do right if you if the room collection has only an id how did you extract channels um no so it doesn't have an id these are the channels this is going to be like a doc these are all channels so the room all of these documents would be the channels and then the doc.data would be the data inside of each one okay so let's go ahead and save and then you see guys that looks pretty clean okay but you see look at that oh it shouldn't be triggering it should only be triggering on the abc it should it shouldn't be triggering on this one right so we've got a problem there so the problem there is we've got a channel option but what we need to actually do is say select channel okay so at this point what we need to do is say well we have select channel so now what i'm going to do is firstly this should this is oh oops if we go to sidebar we don't need the add channel option here we don't want that we refresh and you should have it so that only the add channel makes the pop-up come up if you click this one it shouldn't make it pop up because what we actually want to do is trigger off the select channel function okay so there we go right so now what i'm going to do is um curious says uh so this is a much more upgraded slack clone so this has style components redox and firebase hooks so i love a lot more all right um all right let's carry on guys so select channel so inside the select channel what i'm going to do is this is where i'm going to use redux so what i want to do is every time we select a room i want to push the id into my redux right now what is redux right redux is like a global store so think of our application where every single component has state which is like some kind of memory inside of it right now if i need some memory to exist and kind of float around my entire app and i just need to pull it when i need to redox is basically it's going to solve that problem for us it's going to act as something like a global store it's going to be like a global place where we can access and store variables now how do we push data into redux we dispatch something called an action which allows us to manipulate the sort of data which lies inside the redux slices now what we do is in today's build we're only going to have one slice which is just going to refer to all the app contents but you can actually divide that global store up in things that make sense let's say you had an e-commerce site you could have a basket slice a user slice and all that cool stuff okay so a lot a lot to learn here and it's going to be a lot of fun okay so what we're going to do now is actually prepare redux and it's going to be a lot simpler than you think okay so let's go ahead and jump into that so i'm going to go over to my code and i'm going to go ahead and say where we have oh and you'll sing thank you so much dude it does not matter if it's a he says a small donation but dude any donation is massively appreciated thank you so much so here we have um says chatting away to everyone here we go in app store.js so i want to rename this to not be the counter reducer i'm going to rename all of these things to become app reducer so i'm going to have one kind of global store inside of this build but typically you should spread it out based on like you know what's in the basket what's in the sort of user information that sort of stuff so at this point i need to go to my um i need to go to my features click that and i'm going to rename counter slice to become app slice right app slice there we go all right perfect now i'm going to jump into app slice and over here what i need to do is i need to start renaming this so i'm going to rename these two things to become app and then i'm going to go here and this is actually going to become room id this is the initial state of that global store right now i just have a room id which by default in the beginning is going to be no it's not going to have a value okay um right so please don't spam dude um you're gonna get blocked so sorry about that dude um so at this point what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go ahead and say let's go down here i'm gonna get rid of this increment async there we go boom and then i'm going to go ahead and actually change this up a little bit so where we have features down here i'm going to change this to have uh sort of an action and let's think about what is the action when we click that button we kind of want to enter the room okay and by entering the room what i'm going to do is i'm going to take the id okay i'm going to take the id of the sort of the the sidebar option i just click so the room i'm going to get the id and basically push it into the store with the enter room action okay so let's go ahead and do that right now so i'm gonna get rid of these two actions we don't need them right now okay and every single action inside this reducers section is these are the actions okay so i'm gonna go ahead and get rid of this comment and all we're gonna do here is essentially go ahead and have i don't know why my kite just opened up strange um so i'm gonna oh we just hit 500 likes thank you so much guys that's incredible man 181 people watching we have 500 likes on this let's hit 600 now let's keep on going man that is insane let's keep on going so so cool honestly and the fact that we had a cut out with the tech issue doesn't stop us man like we have the whole video up after this build is finished it's gonna be perfect you know we don't let this stuff ruin us and guys as i said before there's a two day sale left right you have two days to capitalize on that so first link in the description christopher made the right choice today jumped in but anyway guys congrats we hit 500 let's keep on going all right so for the enter room action okay so we're going to say enter room is going to be our action and this one is going to have whenever you dispatch an action you get the state and you get the action itself now this will make a lot of sense later but what we want to do is whenever we just get that action inside of our state we're going to say change the room id to whatever the action.payload.room id is okay and this will make a lot of sense once we go ahead and break this down and again redux can be scary guys it can be scary but don't freak out about it we're going to break it down and it will make a lot of sense okay abdul says i was the one who did the 500 can i get a shout out there you go dude right so we need to export this so that way we can use it outside so firstly we're going to change counter to app slice we're going to go here to get rid of these and we're going to make it enter room so now that we can use this enter room outside of the uh app slice component i was in function okay so these are called selectors now so once we push a value into the global store how do i basically remember i said you dispatch an action which goes ahead and changes a bit of the store how do i now grab that bit of data the room id from the global store right we have something called a selector selectors are really important you need to learn them and this is how you write a selector so we're going to say select room id oops select room id so select room id and this will have the state that have access to this thing it goes into state dot app but i mean it's defined by app because this is the app slice and then here we're going to say estate.app.room id right perfect and we just got 20 likes insane stuff dude honestly crazy crazy stuff right um so now what i'm going to do is go ahead and say export default app slice there we go okay appstore reducer now everything should be clean here right so if we hit save and we go back to our application and let's go ahead and see no errors that's what we want to see okay so i'm going to go ahead and double check let's go to our sidebar option now so i've went ahead and i've i can push into the database successfully but i want to go ahead and remember when i click one of these for example this one i need to push that room id into the into the um one sec let me see uh yeah i'm going to push that id into the redux store now true youngs has a good question so he says hi sonny love what you're doing thank you dude i have one question what's the difference between using redux and the data layer they approach used in the last uh slack clone so big difference honestly and what we're going to be basically be saying is firstly ellie no we will not be using it but don't spam please um yes difference between redux and daily so they are both essentially global stores right but redux is the sort of commercial level solution to state management okay you need to know redux if you're going to be a react developer it's pretty much used in a lot of the companies you're going to find yourself working at so you do need to have this on your cv and it's gonna be a hugely valuable skill to have okay so definitely recommend you pick this skill up right so at this point we're gonna go ahead and click this and we want to dispatch it so that when we click this it goes ahead and fires off select channel because this does not have the prop add channel option okay so what i'm going to do now is and i just answered that question dude so oh my god solution size thank you sorry for your views i'm just 17 i earn more than my parents do i'm grateful to have you as my teacher that's incredible guys honestly i think we're going to break 600 likes in select channel right now what i'm going to do with the select channel is i'm going to go ahead and do i'm going to say okay if there is an id all right so if we get an id passed through as a prop and the only one with ids right now is the these ones because they're the ones we mapped through from the database these ones didn't have an id and then what we're going to say is if there's an id i want to dispatch an action into that global store so firstly we need like something that allows us to dispatch that action into the global store so we use we need to get the dispatch sort of i call it like a dispatch gun it allows us to shoot actions into the global store okay so i say const dispatch equals use dispatch which is a fantasy hook provided by the react uh redux devtools so let's go ahead and import that and you see use dispatch from react redox we pretty much do that now we've got this little gun that we can shoot actions into the store okay so um there we go so now we're going to do is go ahead and say if id i'll say dispatch right and remember we created an enter room function right so i'm going to type in enter room and i'm going to import it from our features right remember this was the action that we went ahead and done remember that took something called a payload okay that took a payload right uh ronit says i got an internship on react looking for you're helping up coin days dude join zero full stack hero the whole community will help you and me right so we're going to pass a payload here which is we put the parentheses we put an object and inside of here what i'm going to say is i'm going to pass in the room id and that's going to be the um let's think about that's going to be the id right of the the component so the id here now what's happening is when we click this button it will push that value of the room id or the channel id into the global store and basically think about what we're doing here that's going to be the channel that we're actively going to be inside of so if i click this one it clicks the id for that it pushes the id for this inside the global store if i click coding it pushes that into the global store right and this is empty right now so if i say hello you see it's a fresh chat if i do papa fam it'll go ahead switch out papa fem's empty as well hashtag papa let's do proper farm legends let's do youtube and you see it's just pushing different values for the rooms into the global store and then we use that value to go ahead and fetch the messages inside the room all right so at this point what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and vikram wanted a quick look over at the sidebar container so i'm going to take a quick water break where you see that thank you shaker keep yourself hydrated they actually do need reminders when i'm live right so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to go ahead and say on the select channel so we actually went ahead and added this in right so what i'm going to show you is just to prove that this works you can download the redux dev tools and what's amazing about the redox devtools if i go ahead and open the inspector i pull down this redux tab so you need to install redux dev tools on google chrome um and then let's go ahead and click abc right and right now oh nothing's happening okay so let's see why let's go ahead and do it again that's because i didn't refresh but if i click here it dispatched an action now the action came from the app slice right we dispatched the enter room action and now if i click on diff it shows me how it modified the global store so you can see it went into the app store when you went into the room and room was initially know as the default value and it changed it to the room id now if i go ahead and see the action it was dispatched this was the action that was dispatched this was the payload of the action and now if we check the overall app store so imagine the global store this is how we look at it inside the state we can go ahead click inside and we can see inside our app now we have the room id it's currently selected this is how it works inside of redox okay if that if you can grasp that concept it honestly doesn't get harder than that when it comes to redux okay like honestly that's the main grasp of it everything else can kind of come from that okay so let's go ahead and continue on now what we're gonna do that we have the room id we're gonna go ahead and uh let's just firstly test if we can add a second channel let's say papa fab oops papa and there you go you see now if i go ahead and open this up i can go into redux and i can click on the different ones and you see every time i click and what's crazy guys is you can actually rewind so that i can jump back to these things i can rewind and i can actually like kind of like fast forward my application which is insane right and you can see like every time i click it it changes the room id so you see how it's working under the hood right now okay all right so this is actually pretty good so ankit says sonny can you please use uh style components instead of normal css and upcoming clones it gives so much value and learning stuff yes dude i would definitely make sure i incorporate them uh we're actually using it today right so okay so that's pretty cool now now we have the ability to select the channel so at this point we are done with the sidebar right and we're literally six likes away from five to five fifty so whoever is those six people you know what to do right smash that like button let's get that number up i swear to god i think we can honestly keep climbing there's nothing that's going to stop us today um and what song should we have right now let's go ahead and have something a little bit upbeat right so now what we're going to do is actually have the chat section right because we've already got the room id now so i guess we can start actually implementing the messages inside of the chat right now the chat where is the chat defined if we go into app.js you can see chat was over here inside of the home route okay so chat refers to this big section over here right so we're going to go ahead and build that out right now okay so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and say um bowel sword i have connected it i've just done it in a new way right so i'm going to create a chat component and i'm going to go ahead and say in components i'm going to say chat.js i'm going to say rfce and then here inside of here what i'm going to do is chat container so i'm going to go ahead and say const chat container equals styled diff boom boom and there you go and i'm going to go ahead and pull in styled from start components i don't know why it's not popping up on my auto com uh sort of my import it was working before but that's fine i gotta do it manually that's fine save okay now what i'm gonna do is say this is a chat container oops chat container there we go all right perfect so we have the chat container up and running now i'm gonna go back into my app.js and then make sure i've imported this component in to our application so there we go chat gets popped in right there okay so at this point just double check that everything's working i'm gonna open up chat.js and i'm gonna go ahead and say h1 i um the chat screen save and we should see it's not there right now it is actually there but we just need to go ahead and get the color and things like that set up correctly so the first thing i want to do is actually open up the chat screen now it's actually up here at the top so i'm going to go ahead and show you how to fix that let's open the chat screen i'm going to go to my chat container and then the first thing i want to do is i'm going to type in i'm going to say flex 0.7 oops save i'm saying flex 0.7 because i want to take up 70 on the screen flex grow of 1 and overflow y scroll okay so i'm going to go ahead and do this right here save okay now at this point i'm going to save and if you can see if i go ahead and spam this i'll show you what's actually happening you see it's actually underneath the header at the point at this point in time okay so i'll show you how we're going to fix this in a bit all right let's go ahead and save all right so at this point the let's go ahead and firstly do inside the chat screen right so we have the first thing we're going to do is we have the chat itself so the first thing i need to actually do is pop a margin in there so i can see it so if i do h1 let's just say hello okay and what i need to do is i'm gonna see margin top i should do 10 let's just try and do 50 pixels we need to get that right so we can see it there we go so 50 is about right let's say 40 maybe nope it's a uh 60. there we go let me try that one for now okay so there we go we can see it okay so at this point what i'm going to do is i'm going to fetch the room information okay so we firstly need to go ahead and have the room details now what am i talking about the room details um i'll show you in just a sec so what i'm gonna firstly do is i'm gonna go ahead and say let's go ahead and create a header section at the top okay so at the top of this file we're gonna have a header okay we're gonna have a header and i'm gonna create this as a styled component so here i'm gonna say thank you so much jason show i appreciate it dude let's go ahead and hit 600 likes guys come on we can do this style.div right and then here what i'm going to do is go ahead and do the following so i'm going to say start div and then this is going to be we'll start that in just a sec inside of this header i'm going to have a header left and a header right and this will make a lot of sense just bear with me okay so we've got the header left and we've got a header right right so header oops don't wait okay and now what i'm going to do is go and create the styled component versions of these so i'm going to say const at the left equals style.div all right like so we have authentication we have everything inside this board coming very soon okay so i'm going to go ahead and copy this one and we'll say header right and then we go save right there we go looks good now what i'm going to do is we've got header left header right so the header left is going to have a h4 inside of it right so it's going to have a h4 so this is gonna be a h4 oops h4 kite keeps opening up so it's so annoying right h4 and then here i'm gonna say strong i'm gonna have a strong bit of text it's strong not string yeah and then in here what i'm gonna have is a hashtag and this will be the room name okay so i'm gonna go ahead and sort of fix this up with the room name in a second i'll show you how we do that in a sec and then the next thing i'm gonna do is actually have a little star icon okay so i'm gonna say boom star border outline okay let's go ahead and say star border outline paste what accent is this man this is a london accent and then there you go you see it says the room name okay so now i can get rid of the h1 hello and this top bit is going to be the room name okay so at this point we're going to go ahead and pop out the header right section and then we'll go ahead and do the fancy styling stuff to get this finished okay so inside of header right i simply want a p tag and i'm going to have an info outline icon and it's going to say details next to it so it shouldn't say p p there we go and it's going to say something details okay so it's going to have this and it's going to say details and info outlined icon i'll show you what that is in just a sec i'm going to go ahead and pull this into my code at the top there we go save and if we refresh there you go all right so that looks pretty good pretty clean right now now i'm going to go ahead and fix this up so it looks very nice because right now i don't like how it looks okay so here how do i get this looking the way i need it i'm going to say header equal style dot star div and say display flex firstly right this one gets me hyped up man let's go ahead and smash the like button and get 600 guys come on display flex justify content space between right and then i'm going to say padding of 20 pixels or border bottom boom i'm going to chuck that in here all right save and now you guys can see that immediately huge difference right huge huge difference right right so now what we're going to do these are actually not these are not in inline styles these are actually going to be uh yeah so at this point we're going to say header left um and the funny the funny thing i always find is that every like sometimes people actually demand things live i'm like dude i don't think you realize how much we're building in this live session right so here what i'm going to say is i'm going to target the h4 inside because we have the little h4 at the top and then what i'm going to do is say display flex right display flex and then here i'm going to say text transform lowercase right save and there you can see it drops to a lowercase and i'm going to then target the h4 and the icon inside so similar to the approach we've done before targeting the material ui i can margin left in a font size let's go ahead and do that right now there we go looks pretty good okay so the next thing we can do at this point is we're going to go ahead and i think we should also maybe say display flex on that let's go ahead and do this oops that's a horrible world let's go ahead and do that display effects and there you go you can see that let's play flex and what i actually want to do here is to say um let's go ahead and say the margin left is there but i'm going to align items align item center and oops no what is that doing nope they got line item center and there you go right so it looks very nice and we can actually sort of push that slightly more away with the 20 pixel push and there we go okay so that's not actually targeted that one correctly so we need to go ahead and say the h4 in this case actually has it inside of it so h4 h4 is gonna have margin right margin right of let's say 10 pixels very slightly push it away there we go and on the right hand side we're going to go ahead and fix that okay so on the right hand side i'm going to go ahead and do styled is something called felipe this is actually called styled components so style components are very popular and i'd recommend jumping in learning out how they you work and stuff like that very very useful stuff now here i'm going to target the the p element inside do display flex a line item centrally one size of 14 pixels i'm going to target the p tag and the material ui icon inside of it and i'm going to go ahead and say margin right 5 pixels and there we go and this is how it looks on slack right so it's very clean at this point in time looks very very nice at this point okay that looks pretty good i think that looks pretty good okay joshua says your css skills are awesome man thank you so much dude appreciate you all right so over at this point what we're gonna do is we're gonna have the chat over here okay so we've got the nice header section complete okay so we've got the header section complete the next thing i want to do is actually go ahead and add a sort of a sibling component to the header now in order to do that in react you're not allowed sort of two components next to each other so if i had something here for example it would complain and say no no no you're not allowed that so i'm gonna have a react fragment that wraps it and then what i'll do is now i'm allowed to have something next to the header all right so what i'm going to do here is actually have a um a another sort of a div called chat messages okay so in this case we're going to just create a uh let's go ahead and do this to say this is going to be chat messages like this okay and this one is going to be a style component div so it's going to be const equals styled div there we go and we can come to start that one afterwards all right so start div there we go and inside of here what we're going to be doing is we're going to be fetching all the messages and this is where we will sort of list out the messages right so i'll show you how we're going to do that in a sec but in order to do that first we actually need this little chat box where we can actually send in messages okay um deepak singh yes exactly it's about typing yes boom you see it drops it over there and that's the message right so little message as well okay so what i'm going to do is let's start the messages so go back to our chat we need to create a chat component here okay so there you go i'm going to make this a drop smaller okay so i'm going to make this like maybe a chess all right that's pretty good right so we have the chat there so underneath all of this okay so underneath the chat messages i'm actually going to have something called a chat input right we actually have 570 likes guys come on let's keep going i love it man honestly i can't i can't believe it thank you so much guys we're going to create a component called chat input okay now chat input is going to be our own little component we're going to create and this is going to be responsible for this magic okay and what this needs is going to have a few different things right so it's actually going to have a channel name that we're going to pass to it so we're going to pass a prop which is going to be the channel name and we'll sort of sort that one out in a sec so we need the channel name and i need the channel id right now we have the channel id this is just simply going to be the room id now how do i get the room id wait a sec we didn't have the room id did we oh we did because we pushed it inside the store now how do i grab it from the store we use the selector that i mentioned earlier so if i want the room id i say const room id and i say equals use selector this will allow me to pull a value from the redux store okay so i need to simply go ahead and import this from our react redux and then what i do is i get the select room id selector that i wrote earlier and what this does it allows me to pull the room id from the store all right this will mean i'm allowed to basically go ahead and when i select the room you can go ahead and do it boswell says you're doing great sony thank you so much dude thank you so much for everyone watching right now appreciate all of you honestly right so what we're going to do at this point is we have the chat input which we need to create so i'm going to go into my components create a component called chat input.js okay rfce wait for it to pop in boom and at this point i'm gonna go ahead and say const uh chat input container equals styled div right this is gonna be my style div and i need to import styled components but again it's being weird with the auto wing port so i'm going to go ahead and manually do it there we go and this one is going to be responsible for there we go all right so this is going to be my div that surrounds my chat input now for the chat input screen how do we go ahead and build this one out okay so for the chat input screen i'm going to have a few things inside of it it's going to have a form okay so it's going to have a form right right um is anyone else obsessed to learn everything from start or not the whole progression of arts concept karthik we actually cover everything inside um you can use react context api if you want but redux is going to be the professional one to use right so we're gonna have a form inside the form we're gonna have an input field okay now this input field it's just gonna be a normal input phone let's go ahead and say input there we go oh god damn it right input there we go and inputs are self from closing so we don't have that now the input is going to have a placeholder right the good thing about this placeholder is going to have backticks because we're going to have string interpolation so we're going to say message hashtag oops pound and then remember we passed in a prop okay so string interpolation here allows us to have a javascript variable inside of our string so remember the props come through here now we passed in a prop earlier we passed in the channel name okay so at this point i can get the channel name but we didn't actually pass in that value okay instead what we did we passed in the uh room id i think it was the channel id we passed in so channel id okay we passed that one in right so at this point this one let's just go ahead and say message room right so for the mean time until i figured that out okay marty says doing a great job this fire thank you so much dude for the input there we have it right now what i'm going to do is for the buttons i'm going to actually have a button and this button i'm going to go ahead and grab a material ui button yes i'm going to use a material ui button depositing yes right so here we've got the button and then i went the buttons have the text inside so i'm going to say send a message and this button is actually going to be hidden right so i'll show you what with the trick that we're going to do here so this button is actually hidden right and it's got type submit and there's a reason why we do this because if you have a button inside of a form and you have type submit when you type in your input field and you hit the enter key it will submit the button right which which allows us to have that sort of cool functionality without the visibility of a button now when we click this button we're going to have a function click off which is called send message okay uh karthik now i'm full time teaching so i i do zero to full stack hero by the way so zero to full stacker is the community that i built with the papa fam first link in the description two days left for the huge sale and then we pretty much close the doors i don't know why we're opening them up again okay so it's a huge sale right now and uh you guys can go ahead and enjoy that if you want okay so uh don't blame me if you said something i didn't know it ended because i'm telling you now it's ending right so when there's a send message when you have a button event it has something called an event here we say e dot prevent default because default when we have a form when we hit enter on it it will refresh the page we don't want that okay so this will prevent the refresh prevents the refresh from occurring oh yeah prevent refresh okay there we go uh right so naruto i will answer that when we get to it don't worry dude so okay at this point we've got the chat input okay so now what i'm going to do is it says chatting but it's not defined so let's go back to our chat and let's go ahead and import chatting book all right so now if we refresh okay so we've got the message room send okay got itchy yeah ouch all right headphones get uncomfortable sometimes there we go all right so we've got chat input so at this point you can see if i hit this and i hit enter it would actually trigger off the send button okay so uh so what i'm going to do is for the chat input let's go ahead and sort of style this one out right so inside of here what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to target the go into my chat input here and we've got the star div okay so first thing i want to do is i'm going to say border radius to 20 pixels okay so i want it to be a nice little border radius behind it let's go ahead and do this save oops border rate is 20 pixels and this will give it a slight rounded corner okay now i'm going to target the form and i'm going to give it a bunch of properties i'm going to say position relative display flex and justify content center the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to target the input form inside of the form by doing this so we're going inside the form inside the input right and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to say position fixed bottom 30 pixels width of 60 border 1 pixel border radius 3 pixels having a 20 and an outline of none all of this will give us a nice look and feel to this okay boom save and if i go ahead and see that you see that guys look at that it drops to the bottom now this button is randomly over here right but this is actually going to be sort of you know relative to where the screen moves right because it's position fixed and it's bottom 30 pixels off the ground and the width is 60 pixels hence why it's 60 pixels this way now what i want to do is i want to hide that button so i'm going to target the form target the button and say display none and i'm going to make it important so that way it just hides right because this material ui button sometimes you have to override the styles save and boom it disappears right now we just get this nice functionality but if i type in and i hit enter it will trigger off my send message function right if i get rid of this line the prevent default one look what happens if i hit enter see how it refreshed we don't want a refresh right refreshing is not our friend so that's why we don't want it okay so guys let's keep the energy up right because if now we're about to hit 600 let's go all right i'm gonna go ahead and change this one the real says your tutorials are giving me the confidence to go out and apply for software development jobs do it dude you got this man and the papa fam's got your back this is why i say to everyone join honestly join join join this is the best community ever right so at this point we have this right now i'm gonna go ahead and upgrade this so we can fetch this information okay so how do i go ahead and do this now this is looking pretty good at this point now i'm gonna firstly add a message in and then we'll carry on okay so i'm gonna go into my chat input right now let's go ahead and implement the send message functionality okay so the first thing i want to do is i want to protect against any kind of bug right now i'm going to say if there is no channel id right then i just want to return i'm going to return first because i just want to exit this this function i don't want to do anything if there's no channel id present okay the next thing i'll do is i want to access my db okay now the first thing before i carry on actually is i've imported the db because i'm going to need it i need to get the piece of text from this input filled okay so how do i do that i'm going to show you a different way of doing it this time when i say const make sure you use refs i'm going gonna say input reference equals use ref so typically you've seen me do it in a way where we map it to a piece of state but this is another way of doing it okay so we can go ahead and import user f from a react and the way we do is we save and then here we go with another banger let's go guys that's what i'm talking about yeah and now what we do is we go ahead and map this to this we say reference to the input field is input ref and you see it's just a lot cleaner right it's a lot cleaner when we do it this way and now what i'm going to say is i'm going to go into the db dot collection okay and i'm going to go into the rooms okay and i'm going to get the channel by going into the document with the channel id so think about what we're doing here is we're literally going through all right well what happened there where did it go um [Music] where did it go come on let's wait until it loads up but basically we're going into the room itself the document and then we're going into the collection of messages okay so we're going into the collection of messages and all i'm going to do is i'm going to add a message in there because i'm literally writing in right and then to do that what we do is we simply go ahead and we say okay the message i want to add is message and the contents of that message is i want to grab it from the input field okay so how do i grab it from this input field we basically say okay get the input reference get the current thing it's pointing to right and i'm basically going to go ahead and say get the value of it pretty much that's it right that's how we do it we get the value of the input filled at that point okay next thing we did shri khan thank you so much dude shri khan's vengala for a lovely five dollar donation appreciate you dude thank you so much all right now at this point we've got the message now i need a timestamp just think about it this way if i send a message in london and you're based in new york or asia or wherever it is my timestamp is different to your timestamp so if we both use firebase's firestores timestamp then it's going to be the same so we can sort our messages accordingly so how do we do that right the first thing i need to go ahead and import firebase the actual firebase okay and then what i need to do is go ahead and say timestamp right timestamp and what i do is i say at this point firebase dot firestore guys almost at 600 likes let's go why am i firebased on fire so i just saw it and i was like oh my god that's creeping we go to the field value and then we say get the server timestamp and then that's a function basically that will give us the server timestamps now all of our timestamps are the same boom there we go 600 likes wow like just wow man a channel we're getting like the same number of likes as channels uh you know hundreds of thousands of subs like guys when we get to 100 000 subs oh ho the world better watch yourself proper fans coming it's going fast guys 20 likes just flew in like that god damn this is what i'm talking about guys let's go all right so the next thing i want to do is when i send a message in i want to clear the text okay so the final thing i want to do is go ahead and say input ref dot current dot value actually what we can do at this point is we can say okay so you can do it this way right you can do it this way or you can do it a way of uh i've forgotten how you actually clear it now deepak thank you so much man so we can do it this way this was a way of showing you i'm going to show you right now the previous way we're going to say equals value equals input and let's go and say input and this is how we initialize state which is basically how we write a variable inside of react by default the input is going to be blank and we say set input all right thank you so much dude for supporting and then here what we say is instead of this we go ahead and say input and what we do is whenever we type in the input field we say on change [Music] unchange equals and this will give us e and we say okay whenever the user types in i'm going to set the input to a e.target.value e.target value oops oh e dot target dot value like so save and what this will do is it means it means that we need to import this but that was just showing you an example of how you can use references as well i legally said you're doing a great service i've been a react developer for three years but i've learned a lot from you appreciate it dude thank you so much man uh mwah says you are the goat let's go man let's go dude now what we're gonna do is here we have the um input okay we've got the value input here nice and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna get the user's information now we don't have the user's information at this point oh so right now i'm gonna hard code it as sunny sanger and then i need to use this image oh that's even harder right how do i do that i'm gonna go ahead and grab a picture of me for now [Music] all right so i'm gonna grab a quick picture of me and let's see if nothing dodgy comes up so i'm gonna grab my picture here [Music] let me grab a quick picture let's say this linkedin one copy image address make sure it's png that's not even a png i hate when you get a fake png don't you like you know you guys know what i'm talking about when you get fake pngs there we go i've got a jpeg there we go right so i've got a jpeg here it doesn't matter you can use any picture at this point okay so i've just popped in a picture here let me go ahead and come so now we've got the user image okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to eventually have it so when we log in it will pull in that information right um okay so you can do ref or you can do the other way guys it's completely fine right um there we go so and there are reasons for each and all right but we're not going to get into that right now okay so now at this point what i'm going to do is have it so that when i refresh right let's go ahead and refresh and let's see now what this will do is if we want to do is we're going to say after we send that message we're going to set the input to empty okay done so the input empty so now if i go ahead and try this out save and refresh okay let's get our firebase up running okay so we're in let's say we go into the papa fan room and i'm inside the pop family and say abc enter right oh did something happen did it break what happened oh my god okay let's have a look so we're inside here and nothing actually kicked off okay so nothing kicked off let's go ahead and see why okay so i went into message input there we go unchanged value is input set input.target.value message timestamp sunny user image there we go and refresh okay let's go ahead and refresh and let's say let me just double check my terminal okay we're good and here i'm going to say abc okay so right now something's actually freaking out at this point there we go cannot be called with an empty path okay because the channel id there we go makes a lot of sense so we need the channel id okay that needs to be passed in so remember chat okay we got the room id over here use selector select room id so at this point what i can do is i can actually just double check that it gets passed through so i can say console.log the channel id right and then i'm going to go ahead and refresh and i'm going to go and do f12 and then you can see the channel id is no right now okay interesting if i click this one now i've got a channel id okay so with the channel id set what i'm going to do is i'm going to type into say test okay and i hit enter right so i hit enter and nothing actually happened okay which is very very strange so let's go ahead and see why because the channel id got passed in here perfect okay let's go over here and what we've done over here actually is we've said channel id is room id perfect okay and let's refresh all right okay interesting let's have a look why this is happening document.collectionrooms.channel id rooms doc collection messages add okay here we go channel id and we do have the channel id correct at this point we're going into the room and we should be adding into that message is the input timestamp is this timestamp the user is only sanger and the user image is this okay and what you need to do sometimes is just cut the this is a yarn start again okay let's do this again i do see the chat guys but i'm gonna block you if you keep asking me to speak indie i'm not uh a pet okay let's carry on all right all right so let's go ahead and wait for that to restart so now what i'm gonna do you can change the title in the index.html if you do want to yes you can do that so now at this point if i go ahead and say testing although we need to make sure we click a pop-up fam so this goes and we click paper fam i type in testing enter okay so this is interesting at this point right so if there's no channel id it's returning first so let's go ahead and double check at this point when we hit send message if there is a channel id right so let's go ahead here and then let's go ahead and say abc enter oh there we go that's what i was looking for and i'll be called with an empty path okay so that's because i actually went ahead and didn't click the correct channel so papa farm there we go and if i type in test and i hit enter okay so you see guys it did reach there but i wonder at this point if it's actually oh if it's not damn it guys if it's not channel id there we go ah i missed it good spot guys good start there we go that's how you know i need a water break smash the thumbs up button for everyone who got that right well done guys okay now that's exactly what the problem was right so we're going to click on paper fam type in testing boom and you see it disappeared perfect okay so now at this point we're going to go ahead and check if you entered in as you can see we should have in here let's go ahead and see let's refresh oh there we go it came through ah it was a bit of a second but let's go ahead and carry on that was water dylan yes that was water everyone thinks it's vodka but let's go ahead in the top one we say on messages all right so now you can see the message has been successfully entered into the room okay so that's exactly what i was looking for so now we have the collection here message timestamp user and user image okay so perfect we have a message there and the channel name we need to go ahead and pass in so how do we get the channel name and all that good stuff set up okay so inside of chat right now let's go ahead and fetch the information that we need okay so first thing i want to do is get the room details and then i want to get the room uh the room messages so we can do this actually really nicely all right so using the new used collection i'll show you guys how easy it is to do this all right so here import use collection from react fibers there we go we say cons first thing i want to get the room details room details okay so i get the room details and here i'm going to say use collection and then what i'm going to do here is i'm going to say okay oops if there is a room id present right then i'm going to query the firebase database i'm going to say db a to import db and say db.collection uh yes deepak using pusher right so db.collection i'm going to say go into rooms and get the document with the room id okay so this will be the room details right this will go ahead and get us that information okay so that's how we do that in this case and then for the room messages i'm gonna do is a similar thing um i think it's might actually use collection might be um we can check that in a sec actually but yeah we're gonna do this one and then what i'm gonna do is i think is use document instead use a document here we go use document yeah and this one will be doc room id perfect and then what i'm going to say is const i'm going to get the room messages as well and this equals use collection you see how easy this is guys like this is crazy man like it's so much easier doing than the traditional way that you're doing it right you say okay only if there's a room id then anchor should i give you a super chat oh dude all right it's up to you man say db.collection and then i'll say rooms dot doc and we'll say room id dot collection of messages i'm going to go into the messages oops messages and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and say order by okay remember the time stamp that we passed in we'll say order by the timestamp ascending okay so order by timestamp ascending okay and then there you go so it's going to order by the timestamp so now you can see this will go ahead and give me the room messages plural and this will give me the room details okay so how do i check this this actually is doing what it says it's doing if i go ahead and pop open this and i go ahead and say console.log let's just check the room details first room details let's go ahead and do room messages save and let's go ahead and see now you can see look chat 25 26 25 is giving us the data back this is actually correct if i say data and now you can see that it gets us back the room details so in this case if i click on the room i have to make sure i'm inside of a room so in this case if i go into papa fam and you can see that it gets me the papa fam room we're going to abc it gets me abc the room okay and same with the room messages but this will be a collection of documents so you can see it works okay it comes through now how do we pass this over into our chat input it's pretty simple actually the way we do it is we pretty much go down to our chat input and then here where we have channel name we pass in room details and it can be maybe under files we need to do that and then we say pass in the name and now we pass through the room name inside of chat input i can actually get the channel name and here i can actually say message channel name so now what you should be able to see is that by default it says message undefined because we're not inside of a room and we can fix that afterwards but if i click paper fam it will go ahead and it will actually pass that through as the value now have we correctly passed it through as a question channel name there we go lowercase c boom saved right and then let's carry on the guys we are literally come on let's keep going we're almost at 650 likes that's incredible honest i'm i'm a bit mind blown today like we had a tech issue we lost we had to start from zero 650 people came in and like that's just mad right let's go ahead and then click on this and there you go look it says message papa fam on the bottom left message there you go you see that if i click it it changes over here message abc message papa fam and i want the same thing to happen over on the room name okay so for the chat uh there we go game zone thank you so much abdisrockshake oh appreciate you dude he goes the value you bring never stops to amaze me just finish the netflix and i see another build on the way damn keep up the good work thank you dude i really appreciate the kind words honestly that sort of stuff keeps me going so i really do appreciate it thank you man here we have the room name i'm going to go ahead and do the same thing i'm going to go ahead and pop in the jsx and here i'll say room details.data.name okay so data don't name let's go ahead and hit save and let's do refresh i remember by default it's going to be undefined so it won't show any value okay so we can go ahead and change that afterwards and then what i'll do is uh let's go back to paper fam and you can see now we're inside the popup fan room now we're inside the abc room you see it look works very very nice okay it works very very slick right now at this point what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and have it so that we have um let's just double check something i'm gonna go ahead and add so the messages list up okay so we already have the messages over here and what i want to do is actually want to render through those messages and actually sort of do some magic with that so how do we do that we go over here to chat messages i go ahead open up my jsx and i say okay let's go into the room messages and it could be on can it could be undefined at some point because it's a async it needs to fetch it and we're gonna say for every single document inside those messages i'm going to have a pair of code that runs okay and i'm going to basically destructure that that message and that has a message inside of it as a timestamp remember when we push the message in as a user and a user image right and then this has doc.data so we basically are pulling it apart from the message document okay then what we're going to do is i'm going to actually return the following so i'm going to say return and i'm going to basically create a message component which is going to be self enclosing and it's going to take the following prop so it will have a key because we're mapping through a bunch of stuff but what it's actually going to do is this message component will take the following information so it's obviously going to freak out at this point because it doesn't know what this message component is okay so we need to go ahead and create it so i'm going to grab message go over here go to components create message.js save do my little rfc trick wait for it boom pop it in and then what we're going to do is we're going to say const message container right so message container equals star div all right start div boom boom and i'm going to go ahead and pop this in now the message container let's go over to message i like this song right so i'm gonna go ahead and pull in styled import start from style components there we go and guys we are literally near four likes away from 650 let's go come on we almost there so message container now i'm gonna go ahead and pop this in there and then inside the message container we're going to have a few things right so we've already got a few things being passed in so firstly i'm going to go ahead and import this inside the chat boom save and there you go okay so now inside a public fan we should have a message here right but it's not actually being rendered because we have nothing being rendered here so firstly this takes a few props like we just passed in so i'm going to destructure the props and inside we have the message the time stamp and a few extra things okay so we have message timestamp user and user image okay message timestamp user and user image three likes away let's go guys wow this is so sick man i can't believe that we're actually going so fast uh this one's not doing it for me let's go ahead and change it uh you know what let's try out the trending songs on epidemic sounds right so let's see if that works actually no i'm not going to risk anything let's go ahead and do my songs all right let's go ahead and do jump to the bottom let's go ahead and do something like oh this one okay all right so let's go ahead and say 650 oh nice there we go 56 50 likes let's carry on guys wow thank you all that's so cool man all right so for the message i'm going to have a few things we have the image the image source is going to be the user image prop okay so the user image prop and let's go ahead and save it and then you can see that it pops through now so if i add another message and say test and make sure i'm in the correct chat yes because every test remember it's passing through as me right now there we go okay uh there you go nice guys 700 come on let's hit i like target of 700 i think we can do that man i think we can do that all right so let's go ahead and say uh let's have a message info right so message info container which i'm going to create so this is going to be message info which is going to be a similar sort of div the styled component dip message info and then i'm going to go ahead and say okay message info and then thank you anchor appreciated so here we're going to say h4 and inside of that we're going to say user and then i'm gonna basically have some little kind of you know i'm gonna add a jsx parentheses block and then we're gonna say span okay now i'm gonna span a few things right please don't spam the chat dude uh otherwise i'm gonna kick you out all right so here i'm gonna span and i'm going to put in the following okay aisha what's up nice i don't see any chat conversation in twitch it's not but in uh in youtube it's going off pretty good um so now we get the timestamp right now how do we change the timestamp that we get from firebase into a readable string and this is the line of code to do it okay so you guys can maybe break this one down in your own time but i'll explain quickly it basically creates a new date object from the timestamp we need to convert it with this two-day object which allows us to convert and then here what i need to go ahead and do is say two utc string so if i save it now we should be able to see like sunny sanger on this time spent sent that message okay so it looks really good and the next thing i wanna do is underneath this i'm gonna have a p tag and the p tag is just going to have the message itself okay so it's going to have the message itself see like testing testing if i say abc abc abc enter the message down here says abc abc abc okay so it's very hard to see that but you guys can see that's at the bottom i promise it's there all right so the first thing i want to do is start making this look like it's the way that it should look okay guys we're almost at 70. honestly really almost at 70. right um so what we're gonna do now is go into our message container right so here and i'm going to say display flex right and then i'm going to basically go ahead and say align item center align item center and then we'll say padding of 20 pixels 20 pixels okay and then here i'm gonna say go and target the image and make the height of okay 50 pixels all right and then we'll say border radius all right let's just say order radius of eight pixels there we go okay look at that pretty cool right it's pretty cool all right so now what we're gonna do is we're going to go ahead and you see that's actually starting to look similar to the sort of go that we're trying to get to okay so we have the image set so the next thing i want to do is target the message info so i'm going to go to the message info and say padding left i don't want to touch that next button padding left of 10 pixels you can use padding or margin there's up to you i'm going to target the h4 and inside the span tag i'm going to target something we'll say inside the span tag i'm going to do a color of gray font weight of 300 margin left 4 pixels font size 10 and this is going to make the timestamp a lot smaller there you go and it starts to look a lot more like we wanted it to look at that amazing stuff so this is so dope okay that's pretty cool right really really cool uh andrew please don't spam dude um so at this point this is really really good now if i click on abc and i say hello can you see what just happened there look it actually just changed based on what i've got entered in here it'll load up the messages inside that room and it just works just works so clean that's amazing all right it works really really good really clean okay now how do i get this though right so if i go into a new channel right if i go into a new channel how does it automatically scroll to the bottom and if i want to add a new message so let's say testing how do i get that look at that abc wow how do we do that trick all right so we want to get that trick happening firstly you need to smash the thumbs up button joking i just had to do like a you know what's his name uh graham stefan sort of kind of vibe the uh let's carry on right look at the numbers going up man this is crazy okay all right so now what we're to do yes this will be everything that's kind of you're seeing now is going to be on the channel after so it goes straight up on the channel after so you can re-watch it so at this point what i'm going to do is we have the messages here okay so in order to get that sort of auto scroll functionality what you need to do is a very neat little trick okay so we render the messages over here okay so just underneath the end of those messages i'm going to create an uh a sort of a div called chat bottom okay so i'm going to create a div called chat bottom and this is literally just going to be a div an empty div okay so you don't even need to maybe have uh i'm going to give a little bit of padding to the bottom though actually so i'm going to do is i'm going to create a start component at the bottom so and it's going to have a padding bottom of 200 pixels and there is a reason why we do that yeah so so wait for this to load boom and there we go okay so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and say chat bottom now what i need to do is i need to give this a reference and i will show you why because we're going to do some pretty damn cool little trick right now okay so here we've got he's saying are you just front and rear reactor does have no back and i haven't used firebase before so right now this is actually more of a front-end build the firebase powers everything on the back handles it all for us but i do do full stack development yes so what i'm going to do is chat ref i'm going to go to the top and create a piece of reference so i'm going to go ahead and get rid of these console logs at the top i'm going to say cons chat ref equals user f and i'm going to go and say initialize it with a value of no to begin with okay now use ref we need to go ahead and import that so i'm going to go ahead and boom we import it from react like so now to connect to my use ref to this i just go ahead and say ref equals use rest and now i have a big pointing at that at the bottom of the chat because think about it it maps out the messages then we have an empty div at the bottom and the reason why there's a reason why we use this empty div so whenever this page loads i'm going to go ahead and spam this chat right now because i'm going to say hey something like this right there we go i'm going to refresh and let's see that we should have all of this stuff popping uh wait for it to load wait for it to load wait for it to load it's going to pop a fan it's just a bit slow right now but it will work okay there we go nice so you see that that's just because my internet all right but can you see right now how firstly we added the padding 200 so that way we can see the bottom and the second thing that i wanted to do guys is i want it to so that when we go on to like let's say we're on abc and loads of messages if i go into papa fam i want it to scroll to the bottom by default okay so whoa savann thank you dude he goes really appreciate your valuable content which is priceless help me out to get my first freelancing gig last year and you just dropped a massive 27.99 euros that's like a dinner tonight i'm gonna call that one so let's go get some sushi thank you so much gwen uh really really appreciate you do seven sorry sven thank you thank you so much dude appreciate that man so the way i'm gonna do this little trick is i'm gonna have a use effect and the use effect allows us to run a bit of code when the component mounts okay so use effects are written like such okay so i actually cover this in my entire full stack hero if anyone's watching an interest in joining the papa fam two-day cell empty it finishes in two days guys first link in the description check it out ff says sunny i've landed a job in london at stuart because of you dude let's go for a beer man when london lockdown's over let me know hit me up all right so the use effect here right we've already imported over here so i only want to sort of do it when um when the component mount as well as when the room id changes okay so when the room id changes and what's really cool about these used collections is they give you the loading state and an error state i don't need the error state but the loading state can be handy here right so what i can actually say here is that if the room is loading this is firestore right if the room is loading so if the room is still loading with the loading stage changes or re-fire this code and what i want to do is i want to go to that chat reference and i'm going to say okay get the chat reference go to the current thing you're pointing at and scroll it into the view so save and what happens is as soon as it loads it's going to basically scroll me down so this one it doesn't need to scroll down but if i go to the papa fam watch how it scrolls me to the bottom boom scrolled me to the bottom amazing works look really really nice right it works right so at this point then what you can do is you can customize this with some really nice little uh sort of additional extras okay so what i can do is i can i can actually add in this behavior smooth right so if i go ahead and do this behavior smooth now now look at this guys if i go to abc and i go to the papa fam it opens up and it scrolls me to the bottom now that's slick smash that thumbs up button that is damn slick all right this is pretty cool right that's pretty damn fun all right now guys if you're new to the channel you know what to do subscribe it's going to be big we're going to keep dropping these words but we're almost at 700 almost at 700 views right so let's carry on guys 700 likes sorry okay so what i'm going to do now is every time i push a message like look hello see that oh it didn't actually throw me to the bottom so i want to go ahead and fix that so what i'm going to do is that chat reference i had earlier i'm actually going to go ahead and pass that to my chat input right as a prop so i'm going to say chat reference i'm going to pass this as a prop to my uh to the chat input right so chat ref equals chat ref okay so yes it would but this is sort of those are additional features you can go ahead and add on and things like that you can obviously sort of you should add lazy loading and things like that and but this is sort of you know this is enough for for uh one single bird okay um so at this point chat ref okay we've done that so we passed it through and then i'm going to go ahead and grab it here but good good couch use my sql now i'm not using my sql uh okay so at this point we've got the chat reference here now what's cool right is that when i go ahead and do chat input because i passed it over here once i send that message in all i need to do now is basically go ahead and add do the following i just say chat reference dot current scroll into view same thing but when i send a message inside of chat input so now let's go ahead and check this out so let's go ahead and wait until this loads up click papa fam and you can see it should load up scroll to the bottom and if i'm at the bottom over here and i say yolo enter boom guys look at that that's that's pretty damn cool right it's the zero to hero course live or video um so we have weekly live coaching course dude so if you're platinum you'll get a weekly coaching call every single week if you're diamond you'll get a coaching call every week and then every fortnight an additional coaching call which is pretty damn intense so uh i'd recommend that but platinum is the pack i recommend first link in the description check it out we also have the recorded content for the modules so those are going to be pre-roll coaching cool guys um that i go ahead and do i record it and it gets uploaded to the course so you get honestly you get more and more content as it goes and we also have a student area where people publish games and all sorts of stuff so so sick honestly let's hit 700 likes guys if you're enjoying this right now smash that thumbs up button uh it's crazy that we have 134 people watching but we have literally nearly 700 likes that's insane really really appreciate you guys okay so now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go ahead and this is actually working pretty good at this point okay so now we're gonna go ahead and do the authentication portion of this build i think okay so if i go ahead and refresh at this point you see like it says message undefined and this sort of stuff now what i can do here is i can protect this screen from showing this stuff if we do not have this information okay and that's a good idea i think to do right so i'm only going to show any of this stuff if we've selected a room right so what i'm going to say is we'll say okay only if we have the room details only if we have the room details and if we have the room messages should we then go ahead and load up this all right this is a better practice to have and this will basically go ahead and protect so you see that right so now we don't get anything in this we click a channel and then it go ahead and uh goes ahead and loads it that's a lot cleaner okay that that really looks a lot more cleaner when we do that okay so um let's carry on so the farm there you go um nice this looks really good oh nice kush says i use your slap videos reference to build my real estate website that's oh that's actually really cool dude i'd love to hear more about that i'm getting into real estate myself now okay let's carry on guys so at this point we're going to go ahead and implement the login authentication and then we're going to refactor so that these are actually pulling in your names and we're going to go ahead and deploy this bad boy and you guys are going to be able to jump on this app and try it for yourself so it's gonna be so sick right let's do this i know the music is sick i swear it's like becoming like a coding dj i swear my i don't care my music playlist for coding is the best it's like the go of all of all playlists for going i don't care i'll say that it's clean man all right so at this point i'm gonna go ahead and let's imagine how do we set up a login system okay so if we go into app.js this is where the magical begins okay so app.js is where everything sort of starts off from so so now what we're going to do is go inside of app.js now this is really cool okay so before we had to use use something called on auth status right and things like that um that was why yes so what i'm going to do is but now we have the handy react hooks okay so i can go ahead import use auth state which is a really cool hook and this one is so damn good because what we can do is we can say const user look at this if i go ahead and drop this line of code in this gives me the user it gives me a loading status and you get the and all you need to do is pass it the authentication and the authentication we prepped earlier inside of our local firebase file so if i hit save on this now we should have the user inside of our app.js now what's really cool about this guys is that what we can do is we can say okay inside the router right inside the router over here if we have so if inside the router here if we do not have a user then show a login screen okay then show a login screen else and this is kind of a protected route now because else it will render the app okay so it will show the login screen if you if there's no user present it says login is not defined makes sense so we need to go ahead and create the login so here what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and create a login component login.js boom pop that in rfce and guys almost at 700 likes this is insane let's keep going and here i'm going to say const login container equals style.diff boom boom like so i'm going to go back to my app.js over here my login do my import there we go vlog we just imported it and then what i do open up login.js and then in here i need my styled components so i'm going to pour them in and i'm going to have my login container over right here perfect and there you go we have a login right and it's not working yet we're almost there though all right so login container right inside the login container i'm actually going to have an inner login container right so i'm going to log in in a container and i'll make sure i'll show you why we do this it's going to help us out in just a sec okay so at this point what i'm going to do is and guys we are three likes away from 700 let's go wow aisha's ice is there hey what's up aisha [Music] all right let's go guys all right so now log in in a container what we're going to do here and the reason why we see a white screen is because we do not have a user that is inside okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to have the image and this is an image of slack i'm going to pop an image of slack in there and we should see uh logging in the container is not defined so boom there we go 700 likes 700 likes and we have a hundred and so a hundred and forty people watching across platforms that is insane thank you guys thank you so much wow darwin rather a small really smart thank you so much dude honestly thank you so much for for donating i really really appreciate anything that's really honestly kind of you look at that guys the slack logo that's huge i don't like that the slack logo okay so um let's carry on so what i'm gonna do with the login in the container i'm going to target that image and i'm going to make it smaller immediately so that way we can start seeing things right so here i'm going to say okay target the image i'll get the image and then i'm going to say okay object fit contain to keep the aspect ratio object fit contain and then i'm going to go ahead and say height of 100 pixels right over 100 pixels i don't even care this slack this slack build is damn dope margin bottom of 40 pixels and then save and boom look at that looks fresh right now for the logging container over here what i'm going to do is i'm going to say okay let's give it a background color a height of 100 view height display grid and place item center this gives it a very nice extra sort of it will send to the element like so that looks pretty clean looks good all right looks good now for the inner container what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead give it padding of 10 100 pixels a text align center background color is going to be white and i'm going to give a border radius of 10 pixels and i'm going to show you a little cool trick okay so at this point you guys can see it's got a nice little border radius and it looks okay right but i'm going to show you how crazy small tweaks are in css i swear to god can we hit 750. 800. i swear we're going to keep on growing i don't know where these likes are coming from thank you keep on just smash the thumbs up button if you're enjoying this but guys fabian van dyke yes you won in the challenge as well do you appreciate you so guys check out this little trick right very small differences right so this is a very subtle box shadow you can just copy but look how amazing the effect it has right so a box shadow is about to be dropped look at that i swear to god like look a tiny little difference and all of a sudden the whole ui is clean now all right so this is really cool uh redirects can protect you but this actually sort of protects you at a much stronger level because it just it doesn't even load the component in the first place a redirect there is a moment where it kind of catches you then redirects you okay so i wouldn't i would say do it this way to be sure now what we're going to do we're going to reach a yeah i don't know how to pronounce that one but a good gazillion likes um so now what we're going to do is inside of here we've got the image and i'm going to go ahead and say let's have a div of login text we're going to have some login text here okay so i guess what we can do is remember we have a h1 okay and then we're going gonna say sign in sign in to the papa fam okay and then underneath i'm gonna have a p tag and this p tag is gonna have a p not please i'm gonna say papa.slack.com something like that now guys just to shout out we do have a slack community it's pretty damn cool we have over 220 or 30 members now inside of the papa fam sac community to join first link in the description go ahead check it out we're running a huge sale right now papa fam has each other's back it's just the best community you guys seeing the energy right now it's so cool honestly i say let's go ahead and hit save and you can see sign into the popper fan there we go and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to have a material ui button okay now the material i button is going to say sign in with google okay sign in with google like so and then i'm going to hit save and now what i'm going to do is say type submit type submit like so and then what i'm going to say is on click i unclick and i'm going to basically trigger off a sign in function okay now i need to create this sign in function so firstly i need to import the button from material ui core so i'm going to go ahead and do this and then i'm going to go ahead and say this uh where is it material material material ui uh there we go save and then the sign in function i'm gonna go ahead and say consignment const i'm gonna say const sign n equals e boom boom and say e dot prevent default like so okay like this and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna say okay now this is where the fun part comes in okay so look it's got a sign in with google bond but that looks a bit trash at the moment okay so this button looks ugly right and i'll admit it does not look nice okay so what first i'm going to do is i'm going to go in here i'm going to target the button all right i'm going to say okay the button should have a margin top 50 pixels and i'm going to do a few things i'm going to make the text i'm going to change the transformer text change the background color to a green because by default everything is uppercase so it's going to be it's going to be a lot better right jay says suddenly the true beast jay we're nearly like 750 likes dude and the whole thing i crashed oh my god we're just killing it today all right let's carry on guys um all right so at this point um what we're gonna do is oh okay so if there's no form yes you're right you don't need the button type submit i did have a form there before for something else that's why i had that so good catch uh samuel that's what i look for man that's what i look for right so uh naruto thank you so much for tuning in i'll see you soon dude so here we have the sign in now how do we get a google i've already done a hulu club before i'm going to drop down the channel though so how do we get the google sign in okay so google signs a lot easier than you think smash the thumbs up button if you want to find out all right so we're going to go ahead and do it right now i'm sweaty guys going to be like how many of you think i can implement the entire google login in like one line of code right one line of code right one line of code right are you ready for this one line of code is gonna do the whole google login are you ready for this this is where it's just like unbelievable power right so here i'm going to say auth i'm going to pull in my auth from my local firebase i'm going to say sign in with pop-up boom okay then i'm going to go ahead and pass in the pop-up now the pop-up is the provider that we set up earlier okay so there's a provider remember we actually pulled that in from our local firebase file so i'm gonna go ahead and pull that in and then i'm gonna say okay that's all good and then i don't need to do anything after i've signed in i'm just gonna make sure that i catch any errors okay so if there is an error i'm going to alert the user of the error i'll say error.message right okay very cool all right let's just let's go ahead and see if this all works right i mean like that seems a bit too easy to be to be true right so i'm gonna go ahead and hit sign in with google okay pretty cool remember you needed you need to enable that on the the firebase platform i'm gonna go to the proper react team account and boom that was it that was it we are literally logged in right now which is in crazy crazy stuff right and what's so cool about this is that if i go to app.js literally guys this is doing all the hard work for us right now this right here is doing everything for us um i'm actually gonna go ahead and let's see let's let's start some new suggested tracks oh my god okay let's do this all right can we hit 750 likes god this is the papa fam anthem i didn't even realize i was about to play that that's yeah right so i'm going to go ahead now and get the user's information i'll show you how easy it is without having to use a lot of readout stuff okay so are you guys ready all right now what we're going to do is we're going to go into the header and start implementing or using the user's information where it's needed all right this song gets me so hyped up this is when we first dropped announced the papa fam this is where that vibe comes this is what it's all about right this is what i try and communicate in these videos that's what we do guys alright so now we're going to do is go over to header and then we're going to jump into alex says what is this playlist where's the song this is like the papa fam anthem dude this is called don't want to sleep by swift7 and we don't want to sleep here dude we do not want to sleep so header avatar right so i'm going to go into my header and i'm going to go ahead and say okay i'm going to basically go ahead and say [Music] yeah i'm going to say okay the source is going to be oops the source is going to be the user and it could be undefined we're gonna say the photo url okay photo url like so and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna actually gonna have the alternative as well it's gonna be the users displaying it now how do i get these values okay so remember we can actually just pull this in using that neat little used auto state hook from firebase now that's as simple as it is honestly that gives us the user and it just works papa found the movie i like that i like that dude hold on the movie can you imagine that holy crap i'd watch that i'd literally watch it and i'll be the one that someone would be acting right i'm gonna import there we go safe mama says loving this ah there she is all right so now you can see we sign in now there's an issue with that right because the sources use a photo url and it didn't work right so at this point what i want to do is firstly i want to go ahead and make sure that this is all done correct so let's save let's refresh and the header right interesting so the source isn't actually being passed in as we wanted it to and this is because we have header avatar this is using the correct avatar one so boom hover pointer start avatar avatar is over here material ui call done cool okay so i'm going to go ahead and make this easier to read so we can see it and then what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to make the avatar have one click will actually go ahead and do an anonymous function inline it'll use the authentication and just basically calls a sign out function which actually signs us out of the app so with that alone we should actually have everything we need okay so oh man this is another one that we had this is literally all the songs that we had when we first dropped it honestly hitachi just imagine christopher nolan directing a movie and proper react oh my god that's so funny you said that that's amazing dude all right so i'm going to click this and it should log us out there we go okay so it did log us out right so we need to figure out why i'm not getting that picture come through right that's the main issue that we have right now so if i do proper react or team let's go ahead and see it should log me in and we should see it come through okay so now what i can do is to quickly debug this it's fine we can go ahead and say console.log and just say user is user and then let's go ahead and see what's happening in the in the terminal user is here we go and here we've got a bunch of stuff photo url ah that's why okay so it's user.photo url so for the photo url is capital right popper is emotional now it's crazy right [Music] so that's why and there you go look there it is perfect all right that's amazing now at this point we've got proper fan we can click here and what i want to do is i want to send that message as sunny but not through like a hard-coded value okay so what i want to do is i'm going to go to my chat input and remember where we sent that message earlier we sent it with hard coded values here okay so now we don't want to do hard code because why do we need to do hard coded because we actually have the actual thing working okay so this is clean i'm not even doing this really clean code right now okay so what i'm gonna do now is we've got the user being passed no we haven't we've got the uh i need to pull the user in at the top so i'm gonna go ahead and pop the user in like so and i'm gonna go ahead and pull the hook in and the hook does it very efficiently so it's gonna make sure it uses it once and it just reuses it car says go thank you so much dude let's hit let's hit likes man let's go ahead come on i think we can hit 750 dude i seriously think we can do it okay so at this point what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and do auth is not defined we need to import off there we go save refresh like that okay and then the user's name okay so for the user's name i'm gonna go ahead and say user.displayname for the user's image i'm actually going to go ahead and say rather than that one was a user.photo url and the best part about this is we're just getting this information straight from firebase so boom if i go ahead and say proper farm and i go and say yo what's up boom look at that guys if i say abc it even scrolled me down that's clean i don't even care what anyone says that is so clean that is like that he's like i'm proud of that dude that's actually a really really good build like that's the kind of like uh the sort of you know you want that to be you want your code to be that level of like spotless right so that's like i swear i was proud of that that's probably that one guys 11 likes away from 750. okay so at this point we have our app working in the way we expected it to okay everything works in a nice way here we can add channels let's go and say uh let's just say like uh it's a youtube channel okay let's click on youtube and then let's go ahead and say yo what's up youtube and you can even put emojis in says drop a fire emoji oh oops my up in the file oh okay i guess my rocket crashed yo what's up youtube there we go and it works right so that looks pretty good all right so i'm gonna go ahead deploy this in a sec and then we're actually gonna go ahead and do this right does firebase hook some reactions do the same because i heard it actually allows you to go ahead and it uses a use effect under the hood i actually teach inside of zero to full stack hero how to create your own hooks really really fun exercise as well that we do inside the course remember guys two days two days left inside of our sale and then we close the doors to the community and i don't know when we're opening up again but all i know is that the energy is untouchable like is the best like that's it period right so at this point pretty good i think everything here is actually perfect in the sense of besides that i almost missed that the sidebar okay so the sidebar at this point the sidebar at this point has got a hard-coded name we don't want a hardcoded name we want the actual name of the user so what i do is i just pretty much go ahead and grab the user and again if we're not using this oh and i actually have another feature on to do the loading state so if i forget remind me okay carl says really like that scroll to bottom yeah really really cool addition now here what i do is i go ahead grab the user like so save not defined yep i always missed that one wait for it and let's go ahead and import this and guys by the way if you do want access to this code and you feel lazy then the second link in the description is the link to the papa github repo where all of this is available now i want to address something now did you notice how what happened just there i had refreshed the page i was logged in already so if i go ahead and refresh here i'm already actually logged in but what's up andy b you guys can't wait to watch this back later yeah oh yeah dude this really really fun build actually so you see when we refresh right there's a loading there's a point where it's loading and it's not actually sort of it hasn't got the user yet all right i want to have it so it looks a bit like this so look imagine if it could look something like this that's pretty clean right that's actually pretty clean and i want to get that working so how do we get this in play right because that's clean as well right so what i'm gonna do juwan says hi sonny thanks for the amazing one i'm really learning for the first time after years thank you so much dude um so what we're to do now is inside of app.js right here right so in app.js so i'm going to go to app.js and then here we have everything happening we have the sort of you know the user notification stuff but what i'm going to do now is actually have it so remember we pulled the loading stain so i'm going to say okay if it's loading right then i'm going to return a different bit of jsx oops not that if it's i'm going to return different bit of jsx now i'm going to create a uploading so i'm going to create a uploading container so this is going to be a div and inside of it i'm going to have uploading contents another div okay so i'm going to have another div and we're going to quickly go ahead and set those ones up okay so i'm going to do uploading let's go ahead and chuck those at the bottom so let's go ahead and do this to say cons uploading save there we go we've got uploading and then we've also got the second one which was app loading contents these are two styled components and let me know hit the thumbs up button if you like the um part is when you can get mine if you really like style components i am a fan honestly and we didn't even use the most powerful thing like the props use case right so it's actually extremely really powerful sunny best the best go go go appreciate it dude five lakhs away from 750 wow oh man and you see we didn't even actually make full power of a reactor we didn't actually use much of reactor so you don't actually fully need it but you guys can i i implemented it because i want to make it so you can extend on it and by having place you guys don't have to ask you know how do we have it inside of this we just you can pretty much use it okay so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to go ahead and say now where we have this um i'm going to go ahead and pop in here and then what i'm going to do is inside of here i'm going to have an image and this is the slack logo now that cool little spinner that you just saw this is a snack logo by the way so oh go ahead and see something oh okay something looks ugly and this is because i have not done this one oh there we go ah scared me for a sec all right so you see now there's a huge logo that's kind of stuck in the beginning right so we're going to fix that in a sec but what i want to do is that um sunny programming seems so complicated in a good way thank you so much dude um so here i'm going to actually install something called react spin kit okay so you guys can check out their docs their docs are really cool actually and they're very simple the way they explain it they show you a bunch of examples but it's this guy right here kyle matthews and he actually shows the use cases in a demo screen if you want to check it out but right now i'm going to show you how to implement it okay come on jay to pull it up and say yarn add react spring kit we're gonna go and install that now once we've installed that while it's doing it i'm gonna import spinner import spinner from react spin kit and then what i'm gonna do one like away whoa our sign law says something i'm 11 years old can i join the zero to four seconds of course yes dude we have 12 year old in there we have a 14 year old in there two 14 year olds in there there's no age limit 751 likes that's what i'm talking about wow like wow that's just like unheard of level of craziness like how we get so much support is just unreal i don't care man we we don't have a hundred thousand subs yet and we are crushing channels with hundreds of thousands of subs so we're killing it dude killing it so now let's go ahead and say at spinner like so and then we're gonna go oh no that's horrible spinner and then spin up there we go nice let's kick you up a bit spin up and then here i'm going to go ahead and say okay the name of the spinner is this one you can get the names from the demo page and i would recommend checking it out right finn says that is so sick that's what i'm talking about i'm going to color purple and fade in of none but split second so i don't want any animation i just want to pop straight in so you have to say none okay i'm going to save goblin says i did three projects from science channel and i got an offer of 1500 euros a month but sadly gonna make kind of the final round dude well done firstly okay that's all it's all about face to rejection that's a good thing right now the next interview you have you're gonna crush it trust me and if it's not that one you'll crush the next one but it will happen it'll come and you'll walk into that interview one day saying you know i'm just i'm ready for this man and that confidence will come through we teach a lot of this inside the course but it's really like honestly anonymous group says i'm gonna keep this energy up that's it dude keep this up man all right upstairs i was waiting for you dude finally you're back i hope you can continue making videos like this regards thank you so much dude appreciate you um so at this point now we've got the if loading so now okay let's go ahead and refresh you see it pops up while it's loading but we need to style it now okay so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to go to my uploading and i'm actually going to make this look a bit cleaner so i'm going to go ahead and jump on a few things um adam says i've actually started penning these builds out physically instead of building them straight away so i can concentrate on why the code is used more i've learned so much dude that's incredible that's what i'm talking about man that's exactly what i'm talking about so look you want to chuck in text align center padding bottom 100 pixels display flex flex direction column justify content center align item center now while you're styling this you don't want to keep refreshing and kind of guessing okay so what i do is i go to here and i say if true while it's doing well while i'm sort of working it out right so if true and then it will kind of force the screen to stay on right and then i'll just make sure you don't leave it like that they say image i'm gonna say a height of 100 pixels i'm gonna say padding of 20 pixels i'm gonna save it i'm gonna say a margin bottom of 40 pixels now as well okay so margin 40 oops margin 40 and then let's go ahead and refresh oh no wait a sec this is actually this should be in the other container this should be over here i got it mixed up we should chuck this one in the actual contents there we go and you see that guys look that's the actual loader okay please share your working experience i do inside the coaching calls i think we can complete hit that said it oh hit that i think we can hit 800 likes let's do it man if we can break 800 before this video man crazy right anonymous group says something i killed this build exactly exactly that's what i'm talking about right so i want to add a margin bottom because right now it's touching it okay so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to go to the bottom of this i'm going to say margin bottom for you and it will drop it a little bit away nice now how do i get this to center out okay so i'm going to do display grid place item center height of 100 view height and a width of 100 on the uploading container okay boom save and there you go okay now we've got this little loader okay now what i can do is i can change this boolean back to loading so it's no longer forced to true and i hit save all right and now check this out guys are you ready for this boom loading while it's loading it's going to be here and then when the user comes it'll go ahead and pop us in that's clean i don't even care that's so clean it makes me excited like you can tell i i can't fake this level of excitement right i know it's geeky i don't give a crap like that is a geek out moment i was just like on the other day like this stripe checkout team jumped into the netflix challenge i blew my mind when i saw that the actual stripe checkout team were in the chat that's insane man i couldn't believe that so this is a styled components not regular css we're just doing star components and it has a lot of pros and cons there's a lot of pros sorry a lot of pros okay so i'm going to go ahead and save and now look at this guys have we hit refresh boom nice perfect right and then you click on the channel and there you go that is so slick that's really really nice right so at this point guys i think we are i think we're ready to deploy this app are you guys ready to deploy this let me know let me know right now are you ready to deploy this application to firebase and go ahead and uh yeah get this thing working right let's go ahead and do this guys smash the thumbs up button if you're excited a new pum please stop spamming dude yes i've already built that right vikram says i'm ready dude that's it anonymous group dude i'm gonna have to time you out dude please don't do that all right well i think is it yes so we got everyone getting ready for this nice sunny isn't necessary to learn until when css um i mean it's a new trendy sort of thing i'd say right um all right so everyone's ready for this right so i'm going to show you how to go ahead and deploy this okay so let's find a quick let's find a nice one there we go let's just bring this up this is good so to deploy your app right so what you're going to do is you're going to go ahead and pop up in your terminal and here i'm going to go ahead and say firebase login so the first thing you want to do is log in okay now i've already logged in so i don't need to do this but you need to go ahead and say firebase login first the next step is going to be firebase init okay now firebase init basically goes ahead and sets up your application with firebase okay so this is just a huge terminal right now so what we're going to do here is i'm going to go ahead and go down with the arrow keys to hosting okay now you can see you've got a bunch of other stuff here but we're interested in hosting today so we're gonna click hosting on the spacebar and enter now you're gonna click use an existing project okay so i'm gonna click that and then we should see a list of our projects inside of this account right so at this point the one that we created right now was actually going to go ahead and say you guys can see all these builds that i've done it's crazy uh right now we have the slack clone right and this slack clone youtube right so i'm gonna go ahead and hit that one and then here what do you want to use as your public directory this is extremely important do not mess this up all right if you do do firebase in it and do the whole step again right but at this point what you're gonna do is and guys in the meantime i wonder if we can break 800 likes by the time we deploy how crazy would that be let's do it we finished it we'll finish this on such a high man oh in the public direction i'm typing build okay so it's going to be build right so i'm going to hit build and then configure it as a single page app yeah so you're gonna click yes with a y okay so undo this boom save and then set up automatic builds and deploy we get up no we're not gonna do that and then it sets up okay the next step yes you guys are started guessing it right now we're going to do mpm run build or you can do yarn build it doesn't really matter at this point right but npm run build now important step what this does is it basically goes ahead and there's loads of things when we build our like hot reloading and a bunch of other stuff right we don't always need that in the final production build we don't even need in the final production build because our customers aren't developers they just need the fastest app so we basically trim out all the fat of the app and then we basically go ahead and create an optimized production build and as you can see here it says pretty much we're going to go ahead and create an optimized production build so once this is done it will basically bundle up our application into a lovely folder over here called build okay now something important to know you do not touch the build folder pretty much okay so you don't really mess around with the build photo and instead the way you need to do it is that if you touch any of your code after it's gone ahead and finished bundling remember you need to run mpm run build again because it it would be your build would not have the latest changes inside so if you change the code you need to go ahead and do npm run build again and then it will work and by the way guys i hope you like that proper match it's pretty cool just sweating in the camera right so now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and say we're almost 300 likes oh my god let's keep going smash that like button if you're enjoying this so now we do it we did a big moment guys we're gonna go ahead and hit that button right so i'm gonna go ahead and drop a check right let's do it all right guys we're gonna do that we're gonna say firebase deploy all right and this is about to deploy this app to firebase right so it's found the folders in the build folder and it's uploading the folders and it will give us a url in just a sec and i will go ahead and share that url and you guys can go check this out i released it and it gave it hosting url boom that's what i'm talking about guys i'm gonna go ahead and drop that in the chat right now and we have a fully functional application right now go ahead and check it out let's go ahead and see this out right now guys let's see this check it out guys and look at this it's loading for me i'm signing in let's go ahead and check out go ahead check it out let's see if we can do this and you know what i think it's only right i think it's only right that we have one song that does this one right so go ahead pop a reactor team i'm going to jump in on my account right here and there you go right i'm going to go in the papa fam chat who's going to meet me in the papa fam chat [Music] yo what's up guys yo look at this look at that guys everyone's popping in [Music] what's up vikram look at this guys oh man this is so sick how cool is that guys that's so sick all right it's working manuel says i'm playing the same song here hey that's it guys look at that ayush's chat all right we've got abc we got the youtube chat look at that youtuber here i was first how cool is that guys that's so so powerful incredible incredible stuff let's do a overview of what we built today right so somebody said there's an over scroll error on the sidebar yes there could be an overflow error on the sidebar uh remember if we what can happen there is you can basically truncate if it is an issue or you can go ahead and do something else but you can go ahead and remember we built this entire app in three hours guys i'm incredible so yes if there's a tiny little bug somewhere we'll fix it that's fine it's all good the final bird in the papa get up repair now a few things to mention guys let's go ahead and say we have two days left to join the papa fam first link in the description thank you aisha says you've done a great job today guys we do this kind of stuff all the time inside the course right now and it's honestly the best right we go ahead we crush it we do incredible builds we do coaching calls well i just sit down i break the stuff out with you part of the papa fam zero to full stack hero is live it's crushing we have over 230 members strong right now check it out the first link in the description okay and this is me saying it to you because i have a huge sale on right now and if you guys want to get a part of that then it's going to end in two days and i don't want that out because i'm going to be closing the doors to the internal proper farm after those two days up again honestly really don't i'm going to focus on everything uh sunny you're getting faster and faster with this type of clone thank you so much thank you and thank you uh gerard thank you so much from ivory coast amazing stuff vikram says this project was so good uh guys this is incredible day is on that no thank you so much guys and i wanted to say um yeah just feel free to hit the thumbs up button and share the video out let's get this video to as many people as possible remember our goal with the papa fam is not to just like create cool stuff and it's a lot of fun yeah it's a lot of fun but guys we're here to change lives like my goal is to really help you guys change your life right it's in like land a job go ahead and just become a better more dedicated person and that's what i'm trying to do with these birds that's why the papa farm exists that's why we do what we do and i just want to say thank you to everyone who was a part of today's build who was here and if you're watching the replay thank you so much and i appreciate you and i want to say guys today we built an incredible app together we built a really really incredible app and uh it honestly it works so so amazing and somebody i okay we've got a little error over there where it kind of overflows that's fine though we have this incredible app i'm gonna show you my one local one and uh yeah guys this is absolutely insane we built the slack clone and the code is available in the second link the link to the papa github repo is available that's also on sale i mean that's going to be coming off sale very shortly and fantana says sunny love this appreciate you thank you so much guys and uh muhammad says have a great weekend that's it guys i want to say have an amazing weekend this video had redux react firebase hooks and it was a complete overhaul of the previous slack clone it's so goddamn powerful it's so good down clean and we guys we topped it off with start components so again thank you so much for watching and i hope you guys have an amazing weekend this is your boy papa react signing out i will see you guys in the next video guys peace i appreciate all of you honestly really really crazy stuff thank you dear and i'm just gonna give i'm gonna read these comments as i always do as we tune out today but guys thank you so much and i will see you in the next video peace [Music] [Music] me [Music] thank you\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: everyone in this video I wanted to show you slack so slack is a messaging tool really intended for using in your internal team so if you have a team of more than two people slack is a great way to eliminate text messaging emails with your internal team for external you're still gonna use emails and things like that but this way you could go and search through your messages so you could check out the website I have a link in the description and read a little bit more about it but it's basically letting collaboration between people a lot faster so this is gonna really save up some time and sending e-mails back and forth and my favorite part about it is the searchable history because of searchable history you could go back and search for things that you had talked about it's a little bit difficult to do that in email and especially difficult to do that in text messages or even a facebook chat Instagram DM things like that this way it's a lot easier when you talk to your teams you could just always go back so again click the link check out slack and we'll go through the signup process I like to sign up on the desktop and then I'll show you the mobile app and that's the place where you're gonna use it more often than not and real quick I make really easy to follow videos every single day of the week and I have well over 300 videos on this channel on things like slack Evernote Instagram iOS apps and devices so if that interests you please consider subscribing let me just show you a couple of different options they had available if I click on pricing on their website they have a free option that's what I'm gonna show you today and that's up to 10,000 messages that is gonna store so after that it's gonna start deleting it so if you upgrade to the second tier you're gonna get somewhat limited options and you have multi channels and things like that you could just look through these options but we're just gonna get started with the free one so I'm gonna press create a workspace here and it's gonna ask for my email I'm just gonna go ahead and type in my email that I want to use for slack now it's gonna send me a confirmation code so I'm gonna go ahead and type that in it's gonna ask for my name I'm gonna type in my name here next you need to create a URL so make sure you create one that's available letters numbers and dashes only I'm gonna create this one here I'm gonna agree and now it's asking me to send invitations so this is the web app basically this is the one on the website so I'm gonna set it up here then I'll show you the mobile app at the end of this video so let me go ahead and invite a couple of different people from my team to join here and then I'm gonna press send invitation or you could skip this process right now I'm gonna go ahead and set it up I just press send invitation to send that invitation and now I'm right inside of slack so to get started with slack first you want to start by creating a channel so let's go ahead and start there so to create a channel on the side here it says create new channel all you have to do is press that plus sign and create a channel now channels are basically topic of discussion so you could have a simple thing like a general channel or if you're gonna talk about the app or talk about vacations anything you want to talk about brainstorming so I'm gonna call this one apps and I'm gonna create that channel here so if you see on the side general and random already have channels so if I click these channels those discussions already here and apps already have a discussion because I just created it so underneath there this is how you would type out a message this is my first slag chat so you could type that in and it's gonna create that message and you could go back and forth with your team so after people join the team under direct messages you'll start seeing multiple people or you could invite people right here if I press invite people it's gonna let me invite people through this part to this specific channel here so the bulk of your messages are gonna happen in these channels so make sure you create as many channels as you need to organize things a little better and once you do that you could always direct message people individually so if you wanted to direct message someone right here you could just select their name instead of talking to them within the channel that would be a one-on-one conversation here next on their apps if you click apps it's gonna show you all the different apps that could integrate with slack's so you got Dropbox you got Trello you got some of the other tools that are very handy like a sauna you could go ahead and install these and then have these work together with slack at some point I'll make another video of connecting some of these I do want to connect asana and I do Connect Dropbox to this I'm gonna go back here so that's basically the side here and one last thing I wanted to show you up here if you click this drop down and if you go over here to preferences it's gonna ask you to turn notification on or off so depending on how much you want notification you could have do not disturb time basically if you turn this on you gotta start getting notification here and I'm gonna say okay all messages direct messages or mentions or nothing so it depends on your preference if you don't want anything to bother you on the desktop you could just put nothing here or if you just want when people mention you you could do that or if you want just to write messages you could do that through here let me just go back to this page one more time and the most useful thing about this is the search option so under here if you click the search option you could search for any conversation and it's gonna go through any chant that you've had obviously I just created this account right now but if there was a lot of information even up to the ten thousand three messages that it saves between your teammates you could go ahead and search for those here so now that we looked at the web app let's look at a couple of different versions of slack on different devices so if you click this drop-down you say open the slack app if I click that it's gonna take me to the page where I could actually download this so I'm on a Mac here so it's giving me the download for a Mac so I could have a desktop version if I wanted to or I could continue to use the web-based version I will show you the desktop version here since it's different from Mac and PC but I wanted to show you the mobile version I'll do it on the iOS here so we need to download slack so on iOS or your Android device go ahead and go and download slack I'm just gonna go through the app store here to download it and it's just called slack so I'm gonna go ahead and search for it and this is what the app looks like I'm gonna go ahead and download it then I'll show you the setup process so the first time you open slack if you set it up on the desktop you could just go ahead and sign in or if you didn't want to set it up under desktop here is how you get started with the mobile app so just press get started and go through that process I like to really use it mostly on the desktop because that's where I do the bulk of my work but on the go this is great to have so I'm gonna just press I'm gonna do the magic link option here so I'm just gonna go through my email type that in and then I'll go ahead and check my email and I could just confirm right here it's gonna ask me to open the slack app now that the process has been done and I could turn on notification here I'm gonna say allow and I'm all set I'm gonna press get started here and now I could show you how the mobile device works so on the mobile device this is one thing I didn't show you on the desktop so if I slide left here and if I slide left a couple more times I get to work places that's the very last page on the left so it's the one I created here shows up but I could also add new work places so if I wanted to have multiple companies set up here I could just press the plus sign I could choose the email associated with it or confirm another email most likely I would do another one or I could do that different work place under the same email and then create a new workplace and the process is the same way I would set up a new workplace and create a URL for it let me just go back here so that's the very first pages workplaces in this case I'm gonna work on the one I already created so I'm gonna click that and then here you have channels and you have direct messages so on their channels let me create a new channel exactly the same way that you would on the desktop or the web app I'm gonna press plus here and let's make another channel this one I'm gonna call marketing let's go ahead and create that channel I'm gonna name it marketing here and you could do briefly describe the purpose of this channel if you wanted to should it be public anyone can join no I want this to be private invite-only I'm gonna press create and now that channel has been created so now if I press the three lines on top I could go ahead and get some of this setting options and I could invite people so if I press invite people I could type in an email address and send an invite link to this channel I created and if I wanted to see more about it I could press the text marketing there's a drop down and it's gonna tell me about notification members apps all the different things that are associated with here and I could edit this anytime I want to so this is how you edit a channel so now let me go left again so now I have the different channels so the AB channel that I created again every time you slide left you're gonna come back to this channel and if you want to do right messages let me just direct message the slack bot for example and then I could send a message and it's gonna reply back so this would be the same kind of conversation that you would have with someone else on your team once you invite them it's that simple underneath you could do the add mention sign to go ahead and mention someone you could go ahead and attach files if you wanted to if you added a file to your slack or you could access your image library here if you give it access here so that's pretty much I use the mobile app I think it's a lot easier to use than the desktop app I think functionally it's better to use than the desktop app but sometimes running out work is a little bit more difficult but basically it's just three pages all the way to the left is your different workspaces next to it is channels and direct messages and if you slide one more time you'll see the different direct messages that you're having and if you bring this page in that's gonna give you your whole direct messages window here I hope you found this useful if you want something specific about slaking he wants me make a different video about that please leave that in the comment section below and subscribe to this channel as I post easy to follow tech videos every single day of the week and I really hope to see you on the next video thanks so much for watching\n",

solutions this video is one in a series to show you the correct method for installing and properly maintaining your a key ride and gunite grand wheel and components to ensure their maximum performance our gunite brand product line includes 100% made in the USA brake drums disc wheel hubs and rotors for a range of commercial vehicle applications our commitment to deliver dependable performance is the hallmark of our full line of automatics slack adjusters our slacks are proudly assembled in Rockford Illinois and are proven reliable and countless miles of service here you will learn to install adjust and maintain your genuine gunite automatic slack adjuster let's start with the basics an automatic slack adjuster is a wheel end component that serves as a lever to actuate the brakes its arm is fastened to the push rod of the air brake chamber using a clevis and it's mounted on the skm brake camshaft using a spline gear the primary purpose of the slack is to convert linear force from an air brake chambers push rod into torque which then rotates the camshaft this forces the brake shoes against the brake drum to supply stopping power the slack second job is to maintain a reasonable clearance between the brake linings and the brake drum while staying within the push rod stroke limits for producing sufficient braking capability gunite offers a complete line of unhandled automatic slack adjusters for installation on steer drive and trailer axles there are two models to choose from our standard genuine gunite automatic slack adjuster and the gunite 2000 model gunite standard model is designed for use with brake chambers that utilize a threaded push rod and clevis attachment with a 1.0 two inch pin Center distance the gunite 2000 model is designed to be used with brake chambers that have the clevis welded to the push rod and have a 1.3 inch pin Center distance the two models are not interchangeable let's take a closer look at some of the features and benefits that make gunite automatic slack adjuster is among the best in the industry providing consistent brake adjustment for optimum brake performance first our unique clearance sensing design allows adjustments based on the actual shoe to drum clearance and is not sensitive to air pressure history gunite utilizes a decoupling 90 tooth clutch design that provides small incremental adjustments providing a more consistent shoe to drum clearance in addition our use of Belleville Springs enables our slack to produce a large load under small movement in smaller spaces without fading over time this makes it possible for our slacks to have a smaller overall housing size this allows us to clear adjacent chassis components and fit applications where our competitors may not gonna it's automatic relax adjust on the first 10 psi of the apply stroke of the brake chamber so it doesn't react to heat expansion of the drum encounter during any single brake application and the operation of the adjustment isn't dependent on the condition of the air chamber or brake shoe return Springs g'nite drilled worm gear design allows for easier lubrication of the SKF splines to help prevent the slack from seizing and because gun i'ts automatic slack adjusters ah run handed they could be mounted on either side of the axle this means fewer part numbers to order an inventory to stock external brackets are not needed for operation all manual and automatic slack adjusters make adjustments through the rotation of a worm shaft and worm gear gunite slack adjuster design gets its motion to turn the worm shaft from the change in geometry between the clevis and the slack adjuster body when it rotates the clevis pulls up on the link the link connects to the worm shaft through a slot in the link and a tab on the drive the clearance between the tab and slot allows for a controlled amount of actuation without rotation of the drive and worm shaft this clearance corresponds to the nominal running clearance between the brake lining and the brake drum as the brake is released the one-way ratchet repositions for the next application if the brake is already an adjustment the lining contacts the drum opens the clutch and prevents worm shaft rotation as brake actuation continues let's turn now to the proper procedure for installing gunite standard slack with a collar lock clevis refer to the gunite AS a service manual for the threaded clevis installation process before starting work on the vehicle be sure to wear proper protective equipment such as safety glasses next block the vehicle's wheels if the axle is equipped with spring brakes manually cage the brakes following the manufacturer's recommended procedures check the operating condition of the foundation brakes including the drums shoe and lining cams bushings rollers and other components replace or repair worn components as needed next remove the existing clevis and slack stur keeping the existing mounting hardware do not remove the jam nut verify the style of clevis needed to ensure the proper gun ID automatic slack adjuster there are two collar lock clevis designs standard and extended the extended collar lock clevis is intended for use with trailer axles and should not be used on front steer or rear drive axle applications the extended clevis may interfere with the face of the air chamber apply anti-seize to the chamber push rod threads into the camshaft splines before installing the new slack adjuster place the 1 and 1/4 inch collar nut on the push rod against the fifteen sixteenths inch jamb nut next thread the three quarter inch hex nut onto the push rod install the slack onto the camshaft using the original mounting hardware be sure to use at least one inner washer aligning the center of the slack to the center of the push rod next install washers on the outside leaving enough room to install the snap ring on the camshaft there should be no more than a point zero six inch movement of the adjuster on the camshaft using a 7/16 inch wrench or socket adjust the slack so that the collar nut aligns with the threaded area of the clevis do not use an air impact wrench as it can damage the clutch before attaching the 1 and a quarter inch collar nut to the clevis check to make sure the threaded push rod is fully engaged in the three quarter inch hex nut if the push rod does not have full engagement install a new push rod and cut it to length instructions for this step appear later in this video the push rod may extend up to one sixteenths of an inch past the clevis opening if the push rod extends more than this mark the push rod and remove the clevis to allow the push rod to be cut to the proper length after threading the 1 and 1/4 inch collar nut onto the clevis housing place the template over the large and small clevis pins align the slack by adjusting the three quarter inch hex nut on the push rod until the correct centering hole on the template aligns with the center hole on the camshaft using a torque wrench tighten the one and one quarter inch collar nut to the clevis using 40 to 50 foot-pounds of torque once the collar nut has been properly tightened to the clevis tighten the fifteen sixteenths inch jam nut against the collar nut again using 40 to 50 foot-pounds of torque if the jam nut is not properly tightened it will allow the air chamber pushrod to rotate in the clevis this will change the installed position of the slack and prevent it from functioning properly at this time fully apply the brakes to ensure that the slack clears other adjacent chassis components then release the brakes once you have verified the clearance it's important to do an initial brake adjustment adjust the brakes using a 7/16 inch wrench or socket to achieve good leverage we recommend an 8 inch swivel head 3/8 inch drive ratchet with a 7/16 inch short socket rotate the hex extension clockwise until the brake linings make contact with the braking surface of the drum then back off the slack by rotating the hex extension counter clockwise 1/2 turn when backing off the slack you should hear a ratcheting sound this will require 30 to 50 foot-pounds of torque on a new gunite automatic slack once the brakes are properly adjusted refer to the section later in this video on power stroke inspection let's turn now to the proper procedure for installing the gunite 2000 model slack adjuster designed for use with air chambers that have a welded clevis welded on clevis 'iz have a 1.3 inch pin Center distance because the proper mounting angle has been designed into the product it is not necessary to use an installation gauge on this setup before starting work on the vehicle be sure to wear proper protective equipment such as safety glasses block the vehicle's wheels if the axle is equipped with spring brakes manually cage the brakes following the sure's recommended procedures check the operating condition of the foundation brakes including the drums shoe and lining cams bushings rollers and other components replace or repair worn components as needed next remove the existing slack adjuster keeping the existing mounting hardware apply anti-seize to the camshaft splines install the slack onto the camshaft using the original mounting hardware be sure to use at least one inner washer to align the center of the slack to the center of the push rod install washers on the outside leaving enough room to install the snap ring on the camshaft there should be no more than a point zero six inch movement of the adjuster on the camshaft next using a 7/16 inch wrench or socket rotate the hex extension clockwise until the holes in the gunite mm are properly aligned with the corresponding holes in the welded clevis because there is no clevis attached you must hold the link in place while rotating the hex extension clockwise or it will travel away from the slack adjuster body failure to do so can cause the link to disengage from the clutch drive once the holes are properly aligned insert the proper clevis pins and secure with cotter pins next fully apply the brakes and allow the chamber pushrod to travel its maximum stroke clearance must exist between the gunite automatic slack adjuster and all of the adjacent chassis components then release the brakes to adjust the brakes use a 7/16 inch wrench or a socket rotate the hex extension clockwise until the brake linings make contact with the drums braking surface then back off the slack by rotating the hex extension counterclockwise a half turn backing off the slack will create a ratcheting sound this will require 30 to 50 foot-pounds of torque on a new gunite a si once the brakes are properly adjusted refer to the section later in this video on power stroke inspection once your genuine gunite slack is installed it's important that you maintain them properly to ensure optimal performance gunite automatic slack adjusters are factory lubricated and sealed to help protect against dirt road debris water and other corrosive elements however we recommend periodic lubrication at least every six months or 50,000 miles using an nlgi one or two grade grease that has an operating range that reaches as low as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit do not use greases containing molybdenum disulphide moly for short as these can negatively affect the function of key friction components and reduce the slacks operating efficiency to maintain their performance foundation brakes should be checked every three months or 25,000 miles this includes the drums shoes and linings cams rollers bushings and other components check for worn clevis Azur clevis bushings replace is necessary after allowing the brake drum to cool to ambient temperatures check for correct chamber stroke due to different operating conditions chamber stroke tests may be necessary at earlier intervals to perform a power stroke inspection block the vehicle's wheels the brakes must be in the fully released position and the spring brakes must be uncaged using a ruler measure the distance from the face of the air chamber to the center of the large pin in the clevis apply the brakes with a 90 to 100 psi brake application and hold then take a second measurement from the face of the brake chamber to the center of the large pin in the clevis the push rod power stroke value is the difference between the first and second measurements the pushrod stroke should not exceed the maximum stroke limit shown here be sure to use the correct corresponding chamber size for the stroke limit now let's review the procedure for cutting a threaded push rod when a break chamber has a threaded push rod that needs to be cut begin by mounting the brake chamber in the proper mounting holes of the chamber bracket for the specific length required for the gunite automatic slack adjuster if the axle is equipped with a spring brake chamber manually caged the spring breaks for caging and torque specifications follow the manufacturer's recommended procedures make certain that the chamber is in the fully released position using a square mark the universal push rod at the ninety degree position when the square edge is centered in the end of the skm make sure the push rod is precisely centered in the chamber and not at an angle before marking the push rod now from the 90 degree mark measure backward toward the air chamber the proper X distance as shown in this chart marking the x dimension on the push rod then cut the push rod at this mark the clevis is now ready to be installed onto the push rod when servicing the breaks are removing the brake drum following the next steps will help you ensure that the slack adjuster is functioning properly before the vehicle is returned to service the first step is to block the vehicle's wheels if spring brake chambers are used manually cage the spring breaks following the manufacturers recommended procedure next using a 7/16 inch wrench or socket rotate the hex extension counterclockwise you should have resistance of at least 15 foot-pounds and here a ratcheting sound as you rotate the hex extension do not use an air impact wrench on the 7/16 inch hex to prevent damaging the clutch back off the adjusting hex just enough to allow the drum to clear the lining then remove the brake drum once you have removed the brake drum rotate the hex extension clockwise until the cam turns over this will allow the brake rollers to be in the release position proceed with the lining change or brake drum replacement after this is complete properly adjust the brakes using the procedure outlined earlier uncage the spring brakes and perform the power stroke inspection let's look at troubleshooting some common issues gunite automatic slack adjusters are self adjusting this means that no manual adjustment is required except during the initial installation and at the time of a brake realign it's important to recognize that when the pushrod stroke of a brake is longer than the adjustment limit you've got a defective brake rather than one that is simply out of adjustment which may be the case when vehicles used manual brake adjusters but it's not true for gunite automatic slack adjusters there are a number of brake conditions that bear close monitoring brake problems can include the adjuster itself for example it might have worn linkage pins or bushings if the push rod stroke of a brake is longer than the adjustment limit do not manually adjust your gunite slack doing so under these circumstances could have serious consequences creating a false sense of security about the effectiveness of the brakes which could go out of adjustment again soon in addition adjusting your gunite slack manually may result in premature wear of the adjuster itself when troubleshooting check the power stroke as previously discussed you'll know that your gun I'd automatic slack adjuster is functioning properly if the 90 to 100 psi brake application is less than the maximum legal Stroke limit as shown here if the chamber stroke exceeds the maximum legal stroke limit you should take a free stroke measurement free stroke is the amount of movement the slack adjuster arm requires to press the brake shoes against the drum with the brakes released measure from the face of the air chamber to the center of the large clevis pin then apply pressure using a lever to activate the slack adjuster until the brake shoes make contact with the brake drum surface then take a second measurement free stroke is the difference between the release and the applied measurements the free stroke should be between 3/8 of an inch to 5/8 of an inch a dragging brake condition can occur if the free stroke is less than 3/8 of an inch if this happens repeat the manual adjustment process discussed earlier if the free stroke is greater than the recommended distance of five eighths of an inch it is important to perform a function test of the gunite slack adjuster to conduct a function test place a 7/16 inch box wrench or socket on the hex extension and adjust the brake linings up to the drum then rotate it counterclockwise three-quarters of a turn a ratcheting sound should be heard mark the seven sixteenths inch hex extension with a paint pen or chalk as shown here next apply the brakes several times watching the hex rotation the hex extension must rotate clockwise the adjustment is intentionally made in small increments so it will take several cycles to bring the adjuster within the maximum legal stroke limit listed in the chart if the powerstroke is greater than the maximum legal stroke limit the free stroke is greater than 5/8 of an inch and the function test shows that the adjusting mechanism is working check the clevis pins clevis pin holes and the arm bushing for wear if any of these components are worn replacing them may bring the break within the legal stroke limit now let's look at torque you can check the clockwise and counterclockwise torque by attaching a torque wrench to the hex extension and turn it in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions recording the measurement the clockwise torque specification is a maximum of 10 foot-pounds the counterclockwise torque specification is between 15 and 50 foot-pounds if either of these torque specifications is violated then you must replace your gunite automatic slack if you're gonna taut ematic slack adjuster passes the test for free stroke function and clockwise counter clockwise torque and the break does not meet the maximum legal stroke limit check the foundation break review it for worn cam bushings pins and rollers broken Springs or drums and worn clevis --is clevis pins and arm bushings repair these as necessary and repeat the function test to see if you're gonna taut Ematic slack adjuster now meets the maximum legal stroke limit if the clevis pins are seizing this is often the result of corrosive environments if seizing pins are a problem they should be replaced with stainless steel pins to learn more about the warranty for gunite standard and gunite 2002 automatic slack adjusters visit our web site at

            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: slack is one of the most useful communication platforms out there especially if you're using it for work and in this video i wanted to show you exactly how to use it if you're new to using slack now the easiest way to get started with slack is just by going to slack.com on your computer they do have a mobile version for android and iphones as well and i have covered that in a different video so you can watch this after this video they all sync up and they have a desktop for windows and for mac which looks identical to what i'm gonna show you in this video on the web and i'm gonna show you the completely free version of slack the way slack makes money is with these paid upgrades but you can get started for free the biggest limitation to the free version is how many messages you have access to and the paid version also has a better voice and video call built in for up to 15 teammates where the free one only has one-to-one voice and video calls once i show you inside of slack you'll see why it may be a much better way instead of using emails or other ways to communicate with your team members at work let's go ahead and try for free we'll just click over here and even if someone invited you to slack you still need to create an account for yourself when you click the invite link so it's going to bring you to the same page i'm going to go ahead and create one from scratch now as long as you use the same email if you got an invite to that email you may see your workspaces down here your other option is creating your own workspace so if you're setting this up yourself at your job your own company you could just go through the setup process here and i'm gonna skip adding teammates at this step i'll show you how to do all of this once you're inside of slack and i'm gonna use slack on the browser here so it's all going to take place on the web i won't have to download anything this is basically slack so i'm going to briefly show you what's going on and what you're looking at and then we'll go through step by step on some of the things you need to know so the very first thing i typically do since i just created this and i'm the only one here is i need to add team members so if you did this yourself and you set this up you will need to add teammates if someone invited you they will add the teammates and you will see all your teammates over here listed below so i'll go ahead and type in someone else that i want to invite you just put in their email here and they will get invited when someone sends you an invite via email this is exactly what that email will look like and you would just press join if you're getting invited to someone else's workspace or someone at your job invited you so making sure all the right team members are inside of your slack here is the first thing that you would need to do and there are options also if you have multiple different businesses for example you could have multiple different workspaces so the one i created is here but if i was to join another one i could add a workspace and signing to a different one so let's say i had my own company and i had a job i could jump in between a workspace i created and another one that i got invited to and it will show up on this side as two different workspaces but for this video we'll just work inside of one workspace the next thing that we need to know is what channels are and how they work basically the main way slack works is all conversations inside of slack all chat conversation notes and audio and video conversations are typically organized in channels and each channel will have a name to the channel so by default i have a general channel the website channel is what i created when i started this project and this workspace there's a random one and i could always add a new channel so let me just go to the general channel to show you each channel starts with a hashtag here and that's just the way channels are organized now typically there are public channels so this is a public channel you'll see the hashtag sign here before the channel name and their private channels which i will show you how to create with public channels it's public meaning everyone in this organization could see what's going on in this channel so i invited the second person and you could see up here it shows two people could see every chat that happens inside of here but that's the reason why sometimes you may want to create a private channel if you only need to have two or three people inside of a channel and not the whole organization needs to know what's going on in there that's what a private channel is so let's go ahead and create a channel first and i'm going to create a new channel here and i'm going to create a marketing channel here and you could leave a description as well and this is the difference between public and private if i left this alone right now it's going to make a public channel so anybody in my organization is going to see what's going on but i could turn this on and now i have a private channel so since i already have some public ones i'll make this private you could also share with people outside of this entire organization but that is one of the paid premium upgrades which i won't do here i'll just go ahead and create this channel and because this is private no one is in this channel but the person that created it so you do need to invite other people so i'll invite someone else which is the other account i invited here and i'll press add so now anytime you jump into a channel just to confirm you could go up here and see exactly who has access to see the information in this channel so if you have a private channel you do need to make sure you didn't invite someone you don't want to have access and read your messages you could always jump in between these different conversations so i'll show you exactly what happens inside of each channel and your communication options but i'll show you one more thing here there's also direct messages typically one-on-one conversations could take place in a direct message this basically works exactly like a text message with one other person so you would go to that person's profile here and you could go ahead and type in a message here and just press enter and that person will get your message so private one-on-one conversations could take place inside of direct messages you don't actually have to create a channel for those even though you could have a one-on-one conversation inside of a private channel as well so i typically like to think of this as just one-on-one text messages and i like to think of these as group text messages the private ones for exactly who i want in that group message and the public ones for basically everyone on my contact list or in this case my organization now let's jump back inside of a public channel here and let me show you everything that you could do inside of a channel so this channel will always include everyone this is a great spot for announcements and team wide conversation so what you could do here is you could leave any kind of a message and you could press enter so i'm on my account here so it's going to show my name here and my message and besides just doing a normal message with any message that you sent here you have options to basically make it bold italic strikethrough you could turn it into a link here and add a link if you want to send someone somewhere else and you have basic formatting options you also could press this plus sign if you wanted to add things to this so you could upload attachments directly from your computer so i'll just go ahead and add an upload here and this is just a image i have on my computer and i'm going to go ahead and send and now anyone inside of this channel could download it you could also click share file from here and share it with other channels even private ones or directly inside of a one-on-one direct message very useful options here with attachments and when you type out a message you also have this little arrow over here which lets you send a message at a later date so if you're doing this after hours it's kind of useful to not send it right away and schedule it as a later message now once a message is received inside of a channel or even inside of a direct message you have a bunch of options available here so if it was a to-do you could go ahead and check it off here and it will get this icon over here you could also react to it in a different way you could also share this message again the way i showed you inside of different channels or inside of a one-on-one conversation and you have a bunch of other ones so you could for example if this is not related to you just turn off notifications you could go ahead and pin this so if you pin it to the channel it just shows up right on top so everyone could see it you see it changes the color of it you could go ahead and save this item too if you want to refer to it and find it in an easier way and you could also get a reminder about this message so if you didn't have time right now you could make sure in 20 minutes that you get a reminder you see i got a little reminder icon so i could get back to it later and a very useful option is this at sign when you send a message so if you want to get someone's attention make sure you press this and then you put their name it will give you an option here to put their name here and then when you type something and you send this message they will actually get a little notification that you're trying to get their attention because if you don't do that pretty much everyone's going to get the same result inside of this channel this way you're just talking to one specific person even though everyone in this channel is going to see it you still will send this person a special notification now one of my favorite things with slack which works a lot better than email is the search bar up here so with slack the power of searching all messages all files and pretty much every conversation is really powerful much better than the results you get out of an email so if i type in anything i could search entire messages files and more and it's going to show me any message with whatever my search term was up here and i have ton of ways to sort it by date how people reacted to it who it was from and what type of channel it was in here or if it was in a direct conversation same with files same with channels same with people this search bar is extremely powerful one of the main reasons why i use slack and let's go inside of a direct message because another powerful option you have inside of slack is one-on-one video or audio conversations call right here this icon let me press it to show you what happens this only shows up after someone accepts the invite into the workspace and basically this is a video call and it's an audio call so as long as you allow access to your microphone and your camera and you answer this call it will bring you to this workspace where you could go ahead and mute yourself you could turn on your camera you could screen share and you could invite other people here as well if you have any issues inside of settings you can make sure your microphone your speaker and your camera are all working correctly if you've used any type of video conferencing platforms that will look very familiar to you so that's going to show up like this once you make a call again it could be audio only by leaving your camera off or making a video conference by activating your camera that's the icon up here and the last thing i'll show you here is if you click your profile icon here you could go ahead and change your status so if you don't want to be showing up as active you could change that here and set yourself as away you could also go ahead and change your notification settings so if you don't want anyone to bother you till tomorrow you could go ahead and set that over here and there are more things on their profile and preferences that you could set up including adding a profile picture and so on and that's your crash course in using slack i recommend watching the mobile version because this syncs up with the same account so you could send messages on your phone on the slack app and then you'll see them over here once you get to your desktop i hope you found this useful please give this video a thumbs up and i will see you next time\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: slack is a powerful business collaboration and communication tool designed to make internal communication between staff and teams more simple and streamlined for everyone hey guys threw it here thanks for joining me today I want to share with you how to use slack in 2020 in this new slack tutorial for beginners I'm going to break down exactly how you can effectively use slack to transition from internal communication using Missy emails to using dedicated channels to streamline communication and productivity within your business now with teams predominately working from home there isn't a bit of time to transition into a easy to use internal collaboration tool like slack now just quickly if you get value out of this video please leave a like and comment down below and if you're new here consider subscribing to stay updated with actionable business tutorials like this one and with that said let's get started with slack [Music] all right so here we are at the web version of slack now you can also download slack on mobile devices for iOS and Android and you can also download the software onto your computer however today we're just going to go through select the web version because everyone can access slack through the Internet now remember slack is ideal for businesses internally for communication as you can see here select brings the team together wherever you are now fundamentally slack essentially replaces emails ok emails internally within your business so we're moving from emails into messages and those messages are organized into channels and that's what we're going to break down and go through today so you understand how you can use this within your business and how it's going to bring the value to your organization essentially what we want to do with slack is increase your business productivity collaboration and streamline the communication okay so with that said the first thing we want to do is sign in now if you don't already have an account click get started or you can come down here and click try slack for free so I'm going to click this button here ok if you already have a slack account you're already part of a team that has an existing work place an existing slack account then come over here and sign in to slack now if you're creating a new slack workplace this is the first time you've ever used slack and come over here and click create a slack workplace and here we want to create our account so pop in your full name here then add your email address and add a password then once you've added your information come down here and click create account now if you do not want to receive emails promotional material from slack then just uncheck this box here and then click create account you can navigate over here and click Save to save this password on to your browser then what we need to do is head over to our email and find the six digit code in order for us to verify our slack account then once you've jumped over to your inbox your email inbox all we need to do is copy this code here and return back to the Select website and here we just need to paste in those digits here we want to add our company's name this can also be your team's name it's completely up to you and then when you're happy with your company or team's name pop down here and click Next and here you'll be asked what you're going to use slack for so for us we're going to click on working on a project because that's what we want to use slack for working internally on a project with the team then we're also going to select staying connected and then we will also select sharing ideas you want to select at least two options and when you're happy with those options then pop down here and click Next you can also skip this step but I recommend choosing a few of these options so you can get started with the channels then when you're happy with that come down and click Next then what we want to do is add our team to slack so think about the people the people within your organization that you want to work on projects with so all you need to do is add their emails here or you can come down here and copy this link by clicking copy link and then you can send that link directly to your team directly to your staff or other people within your organization that you want to collaborate with through slack so I'm just going to quickly add two of my team members here and once you have added your team members come down here and click invite now you can add your team members later on down the track you can skip this step or you can invite additional team members later on once we've finished the setup so I'm gonna click invite and here we go welcome to your slack dashboard so this is where the magic happens now remember the idea of slack is to move away from internal communication using emails into messages as you can see here we can write a message and those messages are grouped into channels so as you can see we have ideas projects team and a Welcome Channel now with each channel you can communicate with everyone there is part of this particular channel before we dive into all the details so you can understand how slack works as a beginner first we'll just quickly cover an overview of your slack dashboard so first things first if we hit up to the left hand side this is where we can create a new message so if you click on new message here you have the option to send a new message to one of the channels now like I mentioned before we have four channels on this side and we can edit the channel name and we can add additional channels so for example if I click on welcome this is the new channel that's been created I can come down here and I can type in a welcome message to everyone that's part of this team part of this channel and as you can see I've just typed up a quick message to everyone that is now part of this channel for us to communicate welcome to slack here we can collaborate and communicate with complete ease so everyone that's part of this channel as you can see welcome here welcome everyone it's part of welcome we'll see this message now I can come down here and is a few options for example there's shortcuts bold italic strikethrough I can add code if I'm more advanced I can come down here and enter a link I can create a list I can add bullet points blockquote and code block there's options here that you can choose from so play around with these different features then we can come across to the right-hand side and we can hide the formatting we can mention someone we can add emojis and we can attach files or documents then when you're happy with your message you've added your documents you've added your emojis and you've tagged individuals that you want to see this particular message then click send message and as you can see I have seen this first message so even it's part of this channel can now see the message now on the left hand side we also have our account details which we'll cover shortly then we have drafts we can add additional people here by clicking add and here you can add the email address of the team member or the staff that you want to join your slack you can give them a name and these people can then change their name later on if they like so once you have added additional people we can click send invitation so we'll just exit out of that for now we don't want to invite any more people as this is just a tutorial so exit out of that one then we can come down to files and if we click on files this is where you'll see all the team files that have been uploaded so this is where you can upload files to share in channels then if we navigate over to channels again we can add another channel so if I click add Channel I can come down and browse a channel or create channel so if I click create a channel here I can give the channel a name now remember what we're doing is organizing what would usually be email conversations into topics so as the example suggests up here we have marketing now let's say I am a web designer we're a web designing company so a name of this channel could be design then I can come down here and add a description if I like and then once you've added your description we can come down here and we can make this channel private or unproven and then when you're happy with your name description and you've made your channel private come down here and select create here you want to add people to your channel so here I'm going to add my two team members that I added earlier then click done and remember you can add more people later on so here we are on design so it's as simple as that to create additional channels now as a web designer I would also add other channels so for example I could add graphic design I could add website design marketing sales and possibly Friday drinks and these would all be independent channels which I'd add relevant people to that I want to communicate with and collaborate with for that secular task or project now if we come down here you can actually direct message individuals so again rather than messy email what you can do is come down here and you can click on the team member or you can click on the individual and then you can come up here and say hello if you haven't communicated with them before and then come down here and click either this suggested message and add your custom message just like that I developed one let me know if you need help with your web design project I have free time today and that will go directly to developer 1 now as you can see develop one has not signed up for select yet so your message will be sent to them via email and when they sign up to slack then they'll be able to access this exact dashboard just like mine now remember this is a direct message so only developer one can see this message again I could click developer two and I could send a message here and then I can come down here and invite additional people so once again it's very basic we have channels which we can create additional channels we can make them private or public then we can come down here and send direct messages just like if we were to send a message to one of our team members very simple and straightforward and streamlined then if we navigate up to the top we can change our settings here so if we click on Scindia media down here we can see that you're set to active we can click change and this just shows that we're away so now people that are part of our slack will notice that we are offline now when you're back online just click then we can come down here and you can update your status for everyone to see we can also come down to notifications if you don't want to see notifications pop up on your device or on your computer then you can pause them for a specific amount of time then we can come down here and click view profile here we can edit our profile so we can change our profile picture we can add a title we'll head back up to Scindia media and then we will come down here again we can invite people to send yo media our organization another important thing to know as if we come down here and select manage apps here we can connect apps to slack so if we head over to browse app directory as you can see there are tons of apps that we can connect to select to enhance the communication and collaboration for example we can connect Gmail Dropbox Google Drive we got zoom here that we can connect Monday comm there's many tools that you can choose from to enhance their communication we have Trello down here so there's many apps that we can integrate with slack to make communication a lot easier within our organization so again you can identify the app download it and connect it to your account so that's one of the most powerful things about slack is that it easily integrates with other productivity communication and collaboration tools to make your work more streamlined so what we'll do now is head back to our slack dashboard by navigating up to the top left and clicking slack as you can see very straightforward very simplistic very easy to collaborate with your team especially if they're in a remote location and this is just gonna help communication within your organization less Missy now with bigger organizations this is great because you can move away from Missy emails and you can start collaborating through messages within channels now the great thing with slack is it's free to get started however there are paid options also so let's check those out quickly so head over to your account and come down here and click see upgrade options now this free version gives the team access to selects basic features okay so this is sufficient for small businesses especially just getting started however if you want more integrations with apps and other features then come down here and you have the option to select the standard version which is great for small and medium sized businesses now the important features that kind of take you to the next level from the free version there's unlimited apps to integrate with your slack account and also group calls with screen sharing and then that other options are for larger businesses that require more features and more room for expansion in terms of communication and product but for now the free version of slack is sufficient for many small businesses the price is per person per month communication tools like this are going to become more and more important as people move away from emails and in a lot of people are starting to work from home this is a great place to interact and collaborate no matter where your team is based in the world so play around with slack with your team and see if it's going to work for your organization and decide if slack is the right communication and collaboration tool for your business and there we have it that's how you and your teams can get started with slack thank you for watching if you enjoyed and got value out of the selector toriel please leave a like and comment down below and with that said thanks again for watching if you haven't subscribed make sure you do so and we will see you in next week's video take care [Music]\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: [Music] hello everybody and welcome to a brand new tutorial series on building a slack bot in python now i'll quickly introduce what slack is in case any of you are not aware but slack is just another messaging platform it's similar to something like discord maybe even comparable to something like microsoft teams i know a lot of large companies use slack for their main communication the nice thing with it is it's really easy to direct message people you can add teammates you have a bunch of different channels there's all kinds of emojis you can have some nice formatted messages i don't use slack all that often but a lot of you guys have been asking me to make a slack bot so i figured i would go ahead and make this tutorial series now in this series i'm going to be making kind of shorter videos aiming to have them about 10 to 15 minutes in length that show you kind of individual things so the first thing we're going to do in this video is just configure the slack bot which will actually take a good amount of time and then we'll actually add it into a channel and have it so it sends a message that will just show you the basics and the setup then from there what we'll do is we'll configure events so essentially allowing us to subscribe to specific events so if a user you know messages in a channel that will send us that message or send us an event that happened we can handle that event and then maybe we could reply to them we could track that message we can see if they send a command so on so forth we can do all kinds of stuff like that so you'll see what we're going to do later in the tutorial series but let's go ahead and get started the first thing we're going to need to do here is just make a new workspace so you can see right now i'm in the workspace i was using before i called it python api tutorial just the slack api i was just messing around before preparing for this tutorial but to create a new workspace you're going to have to obviously make an account on slack i'm going to assume you can figure out how to do that on your own and then if you're already in a workspace for some reason you can click on it and then click add workspace so i've already got that open here this is the page that will pop up when you press add workspace you need to insert an email i'll get my email to actually be blurred here i don't want you guys to see that and then i will click continue all right it's going to send me a confirmation code i'll go ahead and set this up and then once the workspace is ready i'll be right back all right so i went ahead and configured that i guess i'll just call this one slackbot tutorial i'll just label this one youtube so i can differentiate these two and now i have a new workspace i'm not going to add any teammates here let's skip that step and i guess we'll say hello team as our first message all right so here we are we are in our new workspace now what we're going to do is go ahead and head over to the slack api website all of the links here will be in the description you can find them down below and we're going to configure our first app so what i'm going to do is press on my app right here are your apps in the top corner you'll notice that i already have one right here your page may look a little bit different but all we're going to do is press create new app and go ahead and give it a name and then choose what workspace we want this to be in so i'm going to go ahead and name this one youtube bot like that and then i'll put this inside of slackbot tutorial for youtube all right so create app and now you can see we're on the kind of the dashboard here and we're gonna have to do is configure a bunch of different things so the first thing that we're going to do here is we're actually going to go ahead and go to bots like this and we're going to go to review scopes and add so essentially we need to give our bot permissions for whatever it's going to be doing in the channel so we can pick how many permissions we want it to have it can merely just read messages or it can send messages or it can add reactions or it can view email addresses and all kinds of different things like that so what we're going to do is go down here to add in oauth scope essentially the scopes are just the permissions that we have for our bot in whatever workspace we're in so here we can see there's a bunch of different scopes they have permissions for what they all do you obviously could add all of them if you wanted to but right now we only need one and we just need the chat and then right one so i need to find where that is uh chat chat chat come on where are you chat right is somewhere okay so i found it i just searched right here and then it popped up i have chat right okay so that's all we need this just allows us to send messages in a chat later on we will add other permissions and you'll see how we actually figure out which ones we need to add but for now that's all we need the next thing that we need to do is actually generate a token for our bot so to do that we first need to install this into our workspace and then i believe we can generate a token we're going to take that token copy that on our clipboard and then we'll add that to our actual python code which we'll start writing in a second so i'm going to say install app here we can say you know this is what it's allowed to do perform actions and channels and conversations we will allow that and there we go so now you can see we get a token for your workspace so i'm going to copy that token right here i will blur this out just so you guys don't see it and mess with my slack bot but just something to note here that if we add any more scopes we will need to reinstall this app into our workspace so if you mess with any of these scopes you're going to need to reinstall this i don't think the token will change when you do that but just keep in mind it will ask you to reinstall this in the workspace if you mess around with any of the scopes all right so now that we have that we're actually kind of good to go and we can head over to our python code so i'm in vs code right now this is the editor i'm going to use for this tutorial of course you guys can use whatever you want but i'm going to start by just making a new python file and calling this bot.pi you can call this whatever you want it does not need to be called bot.pi i'm also going to make another file here and i'm going to call this dot env now dot env is standing for our environment variable file so this is going to hold our token and a few other things that we'll need later on so that we can actually connect to our workspace and to our slack bot so the first thing i'm going to do in here is i'm going to say slack underscore token equals without a space and then i'm going to paste that token that i had from the slack api so go ahead and do that dot env so just period as the start you should see a little gear icon popping up if you're in vs code if you're not vs code that's totally fine just make sure these two files the python file and the env file are in the same directory then go ahead and save this file now what we're going to need to do next is install some python packages using pip so if you're not familiar with pip i actually don't know what it stands for i always call it uh package installer for python but i know that's not the correct name but anyways we need to go to our command prompt on our system if you are on mac in linux this is going to be a little bit different so i'll explain those steps in one second but start by just typing pip so p i p we type that and you should see some output popping up now this obviously assumes you have python installed on your system now for some reason pip is not working i have a video on my channel that explains how to install pygame so if you follow that what it will actually do is show you how to reconfigure your pip obviously when you get to the step where you're installing pi game rather than installing pi game install the module i'm about to show you here so if pip is working for you then what you're going to do if you're on windows in your command prompt is do pip install spell install correctly and then slack and spell slack correctly client this is what we're going to need to use to actually connect to our slack client so we'll just pip install slack clients now oops let me go back to command prompt here the next thing that we're going to need to do is install python hyphen dot env now what this is going to do is allow us to read from this environment variable file i just always like to use this module it makes things a lot easier so pip install python hyphen dot env make sure you add the python hyphen before all right so we're going to install that you can see that we're already satisfied for me but you guys should see some kind of loading bars and everything should be working now if you're on linux or you're on mac this will be the exact same steps except you're going to go to terminal and instead of pip you're going to type pip 3. so pip 3 should be the only difference here and if that doesn't work for you again i have another video that shows you how to reconfigure pip on mac so that works so i will leave that in the description as well and maybe put a card somewhere on the screen all right now that we have that what we're going to do is go inside of our bot.pi file and start writing some code so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to import slack next i'm going to import os which stands for operating system i believe and then we're going to import something from pathflip now pathlib is built into python 3 by default i will note right now that you need to use python 3.6 or above so you should already be using that version but you do need that so actually i'm going to say not import pathway but i'm going to say from pathlib import and then with a capital p path and then i'm going to say from oops if i can type correctly here from dot env import load underscore dot env what this is going to do is simply load our environment variable file so the first thing i'm going to do is say env underscore path which stands for our environment variable file path is equal to path and then i'm going to put a dot inside of a string here this stands for current directory then i'm going to add a slash and i'm going to do env with a period before it so this is just denoting where the path for our file is so that we can load it next we're going to say load.env and then we're going to say dot env underscore path equals env underscore path again just loading this environment variable file which will load the environment variable that we had inside of there next what we're going to do is we're going to say rtm client which is just the client that we're sorry not rtm client what am i saying this should be client is equal to slack dot web clients web client is what we're going to use for this tutorial there is some other clients built into slack here i'm not really going to talk about them it's just part of the slack api in this specific module in our case we're going to use the web client so we're going to say client equals slack dot web client and then we're going to say token equals os dot environ or however you say that and then inside of square brackets we're going to put the name of the environment variable that we had here so in this case i put slack token so i'm going to go ahead and put slack token inside of here and what this should do is load the actual value from this file and then kind of pass that in as our token so that is how we're going to store the token the reason i'm not just storing it in plain text here is because it's better practice to load this as an environment variable and say you had this on a github repository or something you would simply upload all of the code and you just wouldn't upload this environment variable file so that way no one knows what your token is so hopefully that makes sense all right so now we have client this should actually be working what we're going to do is go ahead and run this and see if this works all right so i got an annoying error here that's saying no module named slack now it's actually good that i ran into this because i wanted to cover this for you guys what happens here is that slack recently like the their api for it or the python package has been changed a bunch so if this doesn't work for you for some reason what you're going to need to do is simply uninstall slack so pip uninstall slack clients like that and then just simply reinstall it afterwards so in this case i'm going to say yes we will remove all of that and then i'm going to say pip install slack clients like that and hopefully this should reinstall and everything should be working fine so that uninstall and reinstall actually works for me you can see i'm not getting that red squiggly line anymore and now slack should actually import properly so let me go ahead and run this and we can see that that actually worked there was no error which means that this is perfectly fine so the next thing that i will do is i will set this up so we actually send a message into the slack client but just or sorry slack workspace what am i saying but if you run this and no errors happen at all you're good you will see an error if your token is incorrect or if you can't connect to your slack web client so next what i'm going to do is i'm going to say client dot and this should be chat and then dot underscore post message and this is simply the method to actually post the message to the chat now the first thing that we need to pass in here is the channel that we want to post to so we're going to say channel equals and then we're going to do the pound sign for the name of the channel and then test or whatever other channel we have so in this case let's actually go back to our slack workspace and rather than just having this general channel here what i'm going to do is make a new channel so i'll create a new channel i'm just going to call this one test like that i will press create i don't need to add anyone into this right now but what i will do is connect an app so notice this is add people and connect an app so i have to add my youtube bot into this channel otherwise i'm gonna get an error so let's say connect an app and then we should see that we have youtube bot i will go ahead and i will add that in all right so now we have the youtube bot inside of this channel and we should be good to connect to it and send a message into it so i will leave this open i guess we'll go back to that in a second but we'll say channel equals test the name of the channel we just created and then text is going to be equal to whatever we want to send so in this case let's just say you know hello world exclamation point now what i can do is simply run this and we should see that we don't get any errors that's great and if i go back to my slack channel here we have our youtube bot saying hello world now let me just show you quickly what happens if i try to send something in the general channel when our bot is not added to that channel so let's say general like that and let's run this and notice that we get all kinds of text giving us an error if we look right here it says the server responded with okay false which means no this was not good error not in channel so it's telling us the bot is not inside of the channel so if you run into any errors just look at this last line here and see if you can kind of understand what was sent but that is pretty much all i wanted to show you for this video so i'll go back to test run this one more time to make sure that i haven't messed anything up and we can get we get hello world popping up one more time so obviously in the next few videos we're going to be doing a lot more advanced stuff this was just the basic setup i wanted to show you guys how we can configure everything and hopefully that's working for all of you so with that being said if you enjoyed make sure you leave a like subscribe to the channel and leave a comment letting me know what you want to see for the rest of this tutorial series

            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: what's going on brian tong here and dreamforce 2021 recently wrapped up there's a lot of interest around the sales force and slack acquisition and how they're moving forward together and why you should care about it so i'm here to break down how slack is working with salesforce to create what they're calling the digital hq now you can click on the info card on screen right here right now to learn more by watching the entire dreamforce 2021 keynotes on salesforce plus but with the pandemic you know what really accelerated how many companies had to quickly adapt and make the switch to digital for business many of us yes we're still working from home in our pajamas and shorts which are super comfy and digital technology has become the main form of communication now over in-person communication and some of us actually prefer that now slack is at the center of this digital hq that enables organizations to deliver for customers everywhere and then allows employees to be successful from anywhere and right now what i'm going to do here is lay this foundation and throw some numbers at you just to give you an idea of just how big slack is and how many people are using it yes we all know slack is a workplace communication tool with fun gifs and emojis but it's obviously so much more than instant messaging this is a collaboration hub that brings together people information and tools all in one place it's a big now millions of people they're using slack every day with 800 000 unique organizations and 177 000 paying customers in over 160 countries one trillion messages have been sent in slack and there have been more messages sent in slack than tweets on twitter and at its peak in a single second 300 000 messages have been exchanged on slack so it is obviously a powerful platform now slack and salesforce want people to be connected to the right tools and allow organizations to be agile in this new version of the digital economy and it starts with slack because when i was first told at the company i used to work at that we were going to slack i mean there was definitely some hesitance about how much more efficient and better it could be than email i was open to it but uh even i was a little skeptical about how good it could be so i tried out slack and this thing is all about the channels slack has channels that you can create on your own for everything and everyone from co-workers to business partners in an office setting you can feel like everyone is separated in different parts of the building or there's different groups that are in their own silos but for me this was a game changer with how i was able to communicate with different people from different teams regardless of the topic or task that was the focus of the channel and even if it's a work tool it can also be really personal because with slack you're able to capture this tone and sentiment and also have fun with the way people and teams collaborate because i can integrate an app like jiffy and then throw in all kinds of gifs because i'm that guy and i think you know who that person is too slack also just makes email feel archaic to me to reach out to co-workers when you're collaborating on projects because a slack channel it's really become this living and breathing thing between the people using it okay let's say you know if i wanted to request a day off and then also brainstorm with my team and also look for a deck with my co-worker who shared it two months ago this is what it would normally look like right welcome to tab city tab tap city population me but with slack it can all be done right here and i wasn't even using slack to the fullest extent now that salesforce and slack are under the same roof slack has this glue that holds it all together for everything involving the salesforce customer 360. and to translate that into non-business speak you can literally do everything in slack customer service hey take it to slack meeting with your team do it in slack sign contracts slack okay let's try this hey slack give me a raise okay well almost everything and if you didn't think that was funny come on you gotta cut me some slack hey who wrote that oh i did now your teams are able to make decisions better and faster and that allows you to execute faster improve your experience for your customers which in turn allows you to serve your customers better and this just makes my business and your business so much more efficient you can customize it with thousands of apps and integrations and you can also create automated workflows and don't get me wrong slack it was pretty slick before salesforce acquired it but there have been a few new things that i'm pretty juiced about first up with slack huddles you can have micro meetings with your team on the spot which take place of hallway conversations this is a spontaneous audio chat that's just easier to jump into on the fly when people are available so you can keep your calendar and inbox open and use your time more efficiently now if you don't want to huddle but you still need to get the message across and text isn't the best way well now you can send short audio and video messages via slack i'm living in this video creation world and it's important for me to be able to share ideas and then connect to teams on the fly to keep the creativity flowing so the efficiency and flexibility of slack just helped make my workflow and collaboration more impactful and yes this is going to sound a little sales pitchy but just stick with me for about 30 seconds because i think it's actually pretty cool i'm actually you know what i'm gonna set a timer for this right now okay salesforce is integrating their entire portfolio products and services seamlessly into slack so we can really handle everything related to customer service sales marketing commerce and all of that in exactly one place and i'm not an expert in all these areas trust me i'm not but i do know that you can't do this anywhere else and even better i did in about 20 seconds now if you want to learn more about salesforce customer 360 hey just click right over here because people are now working remotely and it's going to stay that way for the foreseeable future we're truly seeing this next generation workforce happen right before our eyes because i have friends they don't want to go back to the office and yeah sure some do there is still value in that but the idea of having a physical office as a headquarters is just no longer a requirement decisions they aren't being made at the office anymore and instead it is happening digitally so bringing salesforce and slack together this is all about creating what i guess you could call a new business operating system for this new world of work salesforce and slack the really position to be the center and the heart of your digital headquarters because we are all connected now in this digital world and that means your business can be successful from anywhere and dang after talking about this so much i feel like i actually need something like this for my real life hey wanna learn more about salesforce and slack click here to check out the slack playlist right now on salesforce plus\n",

            "started installing Slack. But before we do that,\n",
            "let's talk a little bit about where Slack lives,\n",
            "because Slack has, I guess you've got three different places that you will end up\n",
            "accessing your Slack account. Slack is a Cloud based service, meaning all of the information gets shared back and forth through\n",
            "web services in the Cloud. Now you have three different apps. I guess maybe we can call them apps. Three different apps that you can use to have conversations in Slack and to manage your Slack installation. The first is you can do\n",
            "it within a web browser. Here is my Slack account\n",
            "open in a web browser. So that's something that you can access from any computer that has web access. And in the web version, you also do a lot of your account management. You can do a lot of things as far as setting up your account. But there's also a desktop\n",
            "app that you can install, which has a dish. It's slicker, it's cleaner, it's faster. And then you can install\n",
            "that in Macintosh or Windows. Most of the time we\n",
            "spend in the desktop app, which will allow us to have\n",
            "multiple workspaces open at the same time, that you\n",
            "were gonna wanna download, which we'll show you\n",
            "about in just a moment. Then there's also a mobile app for Slack. Let me show you that. That's on your smartphone\n",
            "or on your tablet. So you can also download a mobile version, and each one of these tools,\n",

            "access through search. And the search is very\n",

            "that in, and all the times that it's mentioned in our conversations, it's brought forward here. Think about how powerful that is. How many times has somebody sent you a URL or sent you some\n",
            "information and you've gone, \"Where is that information\n",
            "and how do I find it?\" The search in Slack will become something that you use over and over\n",

            "of the secret superpowers that Slack brings to the table. Let's take a quick look at the chat interface within Slack. 'Cause this is where you'll actually spend most of your time. Now you can select either channels, which have conversations\n",
            "in which you basically broadcast your message to\n",
            "everybody in the channel, or you can have specific\n",
            "conversations down here in the direct message area. And I've actually started\n",
            "a conversation with Liz. And I'm just going to\n",
            "continue on that conversation. So it's just like other messaging apps. You just type into the chat box below, and you hit Enter, and it\n",
            "sends off the information, the conversation goes back and forth. Now I asked Liz, I'm\n",
            "actually recording this demo on a Saturday, so I'm asking\n",
            "for a lot from a team member, but Liz, I poked at her and I said, \"Hey, Liz, do you have time\n",
            "for a quick conversation? \"I'm doing a demo.\" And you can see the little thread that we're having a conversation on here. The reason I asked right here,\n",

            "telling me that Liz is online. If she was on her desktop, I\n",
            "would see that she's there. And this is really an important factor. If you are working with team members, knowing who's online knowing who's not, knowing has who has a Do\n",

            "know how many there are, but there are so many. In fact, with the free version of Slack, you can install 10 integrations. With the paid version, it's an unlimited number of integrations. You can lose a lot of time looking at the different apps that\n",

            "and can create some stress. But here's the key to managing that. If you just click here\n",
            "on your account settings, you have the ability to change\n",
            "your status at any point. You can pause notifications coming to you and tell people look,\n",

            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: so my name's Keith and chief architect at slack it's a pleasure to be here at Q Khan I probably the less grueling commute to get to Q con than than most of you our office about four blocks away and Sid stole my my pull the audience for who uses slack lines so now that I know that a lot of you know what slack is this feels a little forced but you know when you talk about slack a lot of times the new stories that people write these days are about new features like voice calls or sometimes they're about the sort of you know some of the strategic things that might be more interesting to developers like platform a lot of people really enjoy writing about BOTS for whatever reasons a lot of stuff gets written about bots but for the purposes of this talk I'm gonna be focused on the sort of a core original use case of slack which is persistent group messaging right so the product category that we're trying to define is group messaging right so a little bit like you know IRC right self self curated channels of people with the same interest groups talking in a real-time way and I talk in a conversational sort of setting around a kind of virtual water cooler instead of like you know you know common thread or an email thread where it's reveals long-form but also persistent right so if you leave work at five and get back at nine you can catch up on whatever happened in the ops channel while you were away and this is sort of a really simple vision to kind of state it turns out that executing it well and executing it at scale in a way that you can operate is pretty challenging so you can expect here today is that we're going to go through a little case study of how a typical slack session works so we have a user and their client connecting to sort of slacks infrastructure running in the cloud receiving messages sending messages and all the sort of internal pieces of slack that interacts with also talk about so much Alan jizz we face right now right so slacks a very new product it's only been in operation for a little over two years at this met this time it's been operational and up for all of its users that whole time so it's still busy being born and I'll talk a little bit about our plans to address them and what state they're in and I've done a couple of Toxic Yukon before you know with different hats on and I've done a lot of these tech talks and there's this tendency to get frozen into talking about your thing as if it's perfect in part because like it's kind of you're insecure right you're talking about the work you do all all day long you want to make it sound like you work at a cool company full of smart people or doing hard stuff which is true the more often than not but it's also a little bit of a fib right there are lots of things that aren't perfect there's lots of things that if you had sort of perfect hindsight you'd go back and do differently and I'm gonna try and not paper over them to to egregiously so a few numbers to get us some sense of scale here in terms of raw headcount of users slack is sort of mega scale and not Giga scale and so there are millions not billions of connected users right Millions with an atom we have peak connected users of two and a half million and I'm sure somebody will correct me if this turns out to be wrong I think that's the largest sort of instantaneous number of open WebSocket connections of anything out there I might be wrong about that I look forward to finding out if I am what's more unusual about the scale and sort of load of the way that people use slack it currently isn't so much the raw crush of bodies although that's getting more and more challenging it's actually just how intensively they use it all right so we're not something that people kind of log into and write a few messages read a few messages and leave for those part people stay connected during their entire workday so for instance the average user is actually intensively using slack alright so actively in focus reading channels writing messages and so on for two hours away for every workday and they're connected on an average of 10 hours for the average workday there's also this impression that everything that slack is kind of a Silicon Valley thing or something that it's all you know start at people using it 50% of our daily active users are from outside the US so you know Europe Asia Africa and we'll see how that trend goes over time and a little bit about sort of our style of solving problems and the kinds of things to expect from this talk so a lot of times people when they talk about their consumer oriented web stack it's a little bit of buzz word bingo over at the so reason this reason that reason that we're using that we plumbed together these two things that way there's gonna be a little bit of a different kind of talk from that perspective if I were to pick with single adjectives for the house style at SLAC it would be conservative so the vast majority of what slack is doing and what's challenging about what it's doing are storage and memory and compute and networking handling failure these the hard part of these things are essentially hard the same way they were ten years ago and the things that have come along in the intervening ten years while sometimes better are also ten years younger and you know full of ten years of bugs that were not that interested in being the people to find out about on the other side of this spectrum we're willing to write some code so for instance when we get to talking about messages a lot of times people expect slack's message bus to be described as you know we set up Kafka and such in such a way and we tuned it like this to get low latency and so on and so forth and to be clear there are places that can be successful with that style solving problems however our experience so far is that the effort and operational know-how and monitoring and alerting and so on that goes into getting an off-the-shelf piece of software to do exactly what you want it to do sometimes is better spent telling the computer what you want it to do in the programming language of your choice so our message bus to go back to that example again is a bunch of Java that we wrote and while that means that we invest software effort in building and maintaining a lot of software it means that it actually does what we want it to do and that we have in-house experts that understand essentially all of it and along these lines we also have a taste for minimalism there are relatively few core pieces of infrastructure that come from outside of slack that we depend upon so for instance if you're proposing that we introduced some new dependency and Kassondra we might have a long conversation of the form well why can't you do what you're trying to do with Redis or my sequel or some other system that we've already got thousands and thousands of server years of experience operating successfully so I had to go to Comic Sans for this one because this is sort of a abusively crude picture of what's going on at SLAC but it's not entirely deceptive so out here on the edge down at the bottom of the screen we've got our clients right so there are happy hopefully slot customers and they've got some floor ality of devices running slot clients right so maybe there is an iPhone now at the lower left running our iOS client maybe there a laptop running are our native Mac OS client or a native Windows client and you can see that there's kind of two big gateways into the backend of slack that these things end up cooperating with one of them is is the web app stack and web app is a big restful application that I'll be talking about more in more detail in a second and the other ones the real-time part of our serving infrastructure which I'm representing the message server here a quick word about I'm gonna be repeating this point over and over again a couple times there's this like fun fact about slack that media stories really enjoy hammering home which is that it started out as a game company or as a pivot from a massively multiplayer online game and usually people just mentioned this as like some funny thing right it's like oh they were a game company haha isn't it weird how like cookies crumble sometime that's true but it actually does kind of come back in certain ways and comes back to be meaningful in certain ways and in a certain way if you kind of squint until your head the actual architecture of slack resembles the architecture of a massively multiplayer online game right so you kind of have your world that you operate in which is your team and in order to kind of make that world seem both persistent and sort of interactively mutable with other things in the world you end up making a pretty thick cache of what's going on in that world and then you've got some way of getting hopefully low latency updates for the changes in that world so that kind of mental paradigm of oh it's kind of like an online game actually explains a lot of things about slack like it's like why we have loading screens for instance that's the same reason that video games tend to have loading screens so we're going to illustrate all these moving parts here going to exercise all the bits on screen here by working through a worked example of a user logging into slack and listening to messages and writing some messages so there's a element of this that's just the internet right so when you go to you know my domain name.com dns does it's magic you know a bunch of Cisco routers are in the way ELB etc and you end up somewhere in slacks web app code somewhere on a dub dub dub machine that slack operates and we call you'll hear me go back and forth between dub dub dub and web app and the contraction web app because the github repo is is named web app and the first thing that they do is this method that we call our TM start so they're gonna use our API our TM in the context of slack by the way stands for real-time messaging so super occurs in the API a lot kind of trips off my tongue a lot we say our TM starts so much that I'll be saying our TM start a lot as well and so a real-time messaging start this is saying I'd like to start a session you present some token some auth magic happens and so on and a word about what's actually happening on the inside there what's running there at that web endpoint is a PHP monolith right is an app law is a bunch of app logic a little less than a million lines of code at this as I said here talking to you that knows where all the business objects that describe your team actually reside right there out in some database somewhere and if you kind of look at the DNA of this thing you can recognize it as a you know very competently executed lamp stack that has had to scale out so for instance it's memcache wrapped around my sequel my sequel really is doing queries for instance that's not all just point queries the actual engine we happen to be using for PHP is the hip hop virtual machine which is is Facebook's JIT for PHP it gets things a little bit faster but it also gets us the option of using a gradual typing system for PHP called hack lang but from 100,000 feet yes it's really really PHP and usually when I when I delve into this sort of whole complicated and interesting conversation ensues and I desperately wish we had time to go into this whole interesting complicated conversation and that conversation usually starts with I like slack but I hate PHP with a raw passion that burns inside and I don't know how to reconcile these two facts they're confusing to me and I wrote a blog post for engineering blog recently that basically makes the weird claim that those are both true right that it is simultaneously true that PHP is essentially a bad programming language for almost every reasonable definition of bad and then it's a very good choice for your application logic for something you're going to serve on the web if you're really curious about this I suggest you dive in there but interest of talking more about how slack works I'm just going to leave that thread dangling for now and ask that you take me at my word on it so now here's where things start getting a little strange and there start to be a few forward references so your team all the business objects that represent your team really are relational data inside of slack there are a bunch of tables that contain things like messages and users and channels and they're designed in sort of a you know relatively normalized form and it is also the fact that we're charting by team it turns out right so team IDs get you to a database where your team lives probably lives with some other teams unless you're really really active or really huge team or both that when I say shard by team people tend to assume that what that means is you take the team ID and you hash it and you project that hash onto some address space right there you take that hash and you mod it or you you know Kodama it or whatever on some set of shards that's not what's going on right the actual layer of indirection that goes from a team to the shard that it lives on is arbitrary and it's arbitrary for basically administrative reasons it's arbitrary so that if a shard gets hot we can split it manually or automatically in some cases we're still sort of in the transition from manual to automatic splits so that metadata of which shard a given team lives on lives on another my sequel database that we call the mains because they're a pair but it's one logical database and that thing knows which domain names RepRap to which teams and which teams map to which shards and not a whole heck of a lot else the process of sort of getting metadata off of the mains has been a recurring theme in our infrastructure over the last year for reasons that will become really clear and with that information in hand we go off and start actually constructing the payload for the response to our TM start so remember I'm claiming that you know slacks a little bit like a massively multiplayer online game RTM start is kind of the key frame that bootstraps the simulation of it right it's the thing that tells you here's the state of the world here's all the users here's all their profile pictures because for all you know while client was disconnected everything changed right for all you know the last time I've connected to this team it was only two people and now it's 2000 people and they've all changed their profile pictures for the election and whatever else right so our team start gives you back this big blob of data that's essentially here's where we're at and to do that we do lots and lots of sequel queries it's the most egregious offenders on this take something like thousands of sequel queries so thousands of trips back and forth to this shard and yes fixing that is something that we're you know constantly working on so a couple words about I've kind of been whistling past the fact that there are these little pairs being Illustrated here I'm gonna keep whistling past it for a second longer here just bear with me so both pairs are across two different data centers right so barring sort of world historical scale crises hopefully these things will be available for reads and writes given a single data center failure and reads and writes you say Keith reads and writes that's interesting yeah hold that thought for a second so my sequel is an unfashionable choice a little bit like PHP not quite as bad a reputation as PHP my sequel definitely does what it says in the outside of the box and it's very carefully engineered but still not we're used to hearing when people talk about their scale-out storage engines and probably the most important reason that we're using my sequel is just the collective history in the universe of the thousands of server years of operating my sequel without it losing data we also actually like the data modeling discipline that relational imposes on us we don't wish my sequel or a document store we don't use it as if it were a document store the way a lot of people scaling up my sequel do and also they're just a lot of in-house experience operating it and writing code for it and writing queries against it and diagnosing performance problems and figuring out you know when it makes sense that a secondary index and so on but don't think of this as some big arrow in the quiver of the no sequel debates because actually we don't you know we throw away a lot of the strong properties of my sequel in the way that we're using it specifically we use it an active-active way we do master master replication so you actually can write to either one of those heads so each one of those heads is is replaying a statement based log and producing a statement based log from its partner and if you have if you you know go out and hold a stethoscope up to one of these logical you know it's a single database logically but they're separate machines they really will be sustaining right traffic on either side of this and there really will be some some lag in the replication is that crosses from one machine to another so we've taken my sequel and made an eventually consistent store out of it and we do this because basically we want to be right available in in the case of failures and we want master promotion to be automatic in the case of failures now you might be wondering what about conflicts what if we actually wrote the same row on either side of these things where we did something else inconsistent like we tried to insert the same value conflicts do happen so basically when application authors at slack are writing query is especially update queries to this system they need to bear in mind the possibility of this and it's where some that comes up in code reviews a lot is like is this actually safe in the event of you know serious master master lag a replication lag if this right happened on both sides would it be safe and the majority of our conflicts that do happen we're able to resolve automatically basically with application knowledge right we know what it's trying to do and so we're able to resolve it but there are human beings who work at slack who have to resolve conflicts that are nonzero rate and this is one of those things that uh you know when I talked about sort of things that just aren't pretty but are true that's a thing that's not pretty but is true it's a thing that is not going to scale forever that we're currently doing a bit of a kind of application level programming trick for making these things a little safer is a lot of these are kind of racy updates of the same structure right so you know you can imagine that I've got my laptop out and I've got my phone out and I'm trying to sort of change my profile picture and both of them to try and catch slack in the act and get you know a be a to happen or something for the most part rights like that are are are what you're going to read what you wrote even though we're doing this master master business because there's a best effort to kind of get read what you wrote semantics using the team ID so the lowered a bit of your team ID is your preferred head all right so even even teams want to write on the left head and odd teams want to write on the right head as it were and of course they'll fail over to actually doing the right song on either side so you still have to think about all these conflicts and stuff but in practice it's actually pretty hard if things are humming along in a healthy way to try to write the same road twice okay so we do all of these eventually consistent queries that let us construct the RTM start payload and we return it to you and it's got a lot of information it's got the identity of every channel on the team it's got the identity of every user in the team it's got the membership of all the channels it's got you know where the reed cursor has moved ahead and all those channels since you lost examined them and blah blah blah blah but the two pieces that we probably care about for our purposes are it says okay you know you did start a session I'm kind of using active user for right now and here's your WebSocket URL right so there's a little WebSocket URL there it's some host name at slack messages com and then the actual applications named WebSocket and then some funny hash of something or other and we'll talk about what that funny hash is doing in a second so the contract here is going to be now that you've gotten your key frame right now that you've gotten your state of the world at the time you started your session we're gonna keep you up to date by trickling cache updates through that WebSocket connection all right so that WebSocket connection if you're using it as a chat app one of the really visible of things that's flowing over that WebSocket connection is just messages going back and forth right so that's where the write amplifier that actually takes a message you send broadcast it to everybody that's where that thing lives and you can see that operating but going on behind the scenes is actually a lot of sort of quiet oh gosh so-and-so changed their profile picture okay cool I'll show the right profile picture and things along those lines also presents information we'll talk about presents briefly too so diving in a message server I kind of gave a little preview of this briefly message server is an actual bunch of Java code we wrote it's message in life is sort of twofold right so one is that it's a right amplifier so things that happen on the team need to be shared to everybody that's actively using the team and it also needs to be sort of communicated to the future it needs to be communicated to all the people who aren't here in space but will be here later in time and so we need to store these messages somewhere we were talking about all this discussion foregoing discussion about sort of master master replication and my sequel and shards and the left half and the right half and so on that's all application logic message server doesn't know anything about it it's in a different language there's no unholy bridge between Java and PHP that we've tried to forge it really side calls into a web server in a way that's not so different from the way that you'd inside call over you know port 80 from the big bad internet so that it can actually persist the message and I'm making it sound like it's really simple so you might be kind of like is this literally just kind of 40 lines of code that you know opens oh you know it's a wrapper around a WebSocket library and then a for loop over the people that are connected well no so one of the things that I talked about there was that there was a contract here that you're gonna get your updates over the WebSocket you might have noticed there's actually a little race here right so RTM start gives you a WebSocket URL time elapses things change the world moves on a little bit maybe some messages even get exchanged and then you go over and start connected and start talking over the real time connection to the web server to the message server rate so that little hash of weirdness that came along with your payload that's actually a little cursor in the event log that the message server keeps the message server keeps an in-memory buffer of recent events and that things actually bounded in real time I think it's 30 seconds so in practice you kind of have 30 seconds to go take the ticket that RTM start gave you and connect to the message server and when you connect with it it'll catch you up with whatever you've missed there's also the fact that we're doing persistence across you know a network boundary possibly a data center boundary so it's actually possible that we're not able to persist a message for a while and then what should we do well you have the option of sort of the sort of clinic distributed systems answer is whoa like we're not in an okay state we're not able to actually send your message right now that is probably not the most helpful thing to do in this situation though right Network weather does happen and usually network weather is you know very brief seconds later we will be able to persist it so there is both an in-memory and on disk queue that we try to recover that the message server operates so it you know persists locally and replay is the locally persisted log if it you know crashes and comes back up or if there's a you know something really terrible happens and it takes a long time for the message for the my sequel and web app to be able to talk to it by the way we really carefully monitor the depth of those those queues if those queues start building up that's a really powerful sign that sort of something is badly wrong with the system and it could be load anywhere from oh gosh the peril of presenting on your own laptop here yeah and it could be load anywhere from the web server my sequel or other systems that I haven't been able to talk about here yet also the vast majority of messages in a large team or presence or I mean by presence is the information that so-and-so opened or closed their laptop so you know your intuition is probably most of what happens is you're sending chat back and forth gets the chat application well know most of what you're sending is like the stuff that drives the little green dots next to people's names when they're online that might seem wasteful but this is actually a really really critical feature like going back to the online game analogy for a second those little presents dots are a lot of what makes it kind of feel like a virtual water cooler in a virtual place where sort of people are you know you're kind of using your brains location hardware to think about slot channels sometimes and the reason that messages that presents messages proliferate this is a little weird but it's true is that this is basically N squared in the number of people in the team so if we actually tell every connected user about every other connected users present status whereas like other ones are kind of narrow cast two channels and stuff then it's just going to be the case that ultimate you know in the long run you're gonna be dominated by people opening and closing their laptops because they do that more often than they post a mess in general that goes to every single user there's another big box that I haven't talked about yet which is the job queue let's work deferral mechanism I know job queue is not a very inventive name but that is what the code base calls it and so I'll stick with it here be one of those things would be fun to make up a name for someday we physically manifest this thing in Redis so there's all kinds of stuff that you kind of don't want to do I have a background as operating system person by the way so I find this analogy just irresistible in an actual web request it's a little bit like the top half of an interrupt handler right you kind of you have real-time you're sitting there occupying a slot and like Apaches set of processes it can handle you want to get what you're doing out of the way pretty quickly so that this server can go on to serve other users but there are things that just inherently take a long time a really extreme example is an import or an if you're just importing you know years worth of data from you know some competing chat product or something that's going to take hours no matter what we do but we want to be able to kick that off using the web application and we want to tap access to all the sort of you know application logic that I've been talking about before but we don't want to just sit there squatting on a open socket over port 80 for hours at a time so that happens to this job key mechanism if you're kind of in the top half trying to get your requests finished in a timely manner you can write a memo to the rest of the system to to do work later and we do the actual physical storage of that in a set of Redis clusters I'm calling it blood job queue by the way it's actually multiple queues so you have different sort of levels of service class some performance isolation by running them in different queues different pools of workers and the pools of workers are sitting there actively pulling for work to do they could use pub/sub but they don't yet but actively pulling for work to do and pulling stuff off of there and by the way this is kind of this is one of those things that seems really the fun thing to take away from this slide if at least if you're me or if you ever end up working at slack is that link unfurling which is like what we call it when we do the little cartouche around a link right so you're in some channel you type HTTP colon slash slash you know twitter.com slash some username or whatever after a second or two hopefully a little box shows with you know that person's profile picture and sort of a blurb about what Twitter is and a little bit of their bio and whatever that all happens in this job key mechanism you want that to be there because right sometimes external URLs fail sometimes it takes a long time to curl something else sometimes that sites just under load and if you just retry again in five seconds it'll be just fine but I mentioned this because if I'm sort of stuck on the subway and I'm trying to make sure that the site's still up and I didn't break it with you know the code I just pushed or something like that I just linked infer or something in a message to myself and if I do that I have just exorcised the hell out of everything I've talked about so far right I means that the web app it means that the web's up it means my sequels up it means the message server for my team is working it means that Redis is operating in some sort of vaguely good way it means that job workers are finding stuff from Redis in a timely way and actually doing the work that's on them it means that the messages that go down through the message server that tell you that job is completed and tell you what to show now are actually functioning and so on okay so we've kind of worked our way through our career little picture here we've got the mains we've got the shards we've we've talked about message server we've talked about web app how they're the kind of two big gateways for sort of the bulk you know session initiation and termination and then the actual kind of fine-grained low latency session information so there's a whole lot of stuff that I'm omitting here so we don't use ROM isequal all the time memcache is there for a lot of performance-critical queries it's basically providing a materialized view of some queries that are important that keep recurring this is currently totally manual right this is currently totally done by people noticing that oh gosh we spend a lot of time on this API endpoint why is that oh it turns out it's this query is it easy to cache is it safe to cache yes it is and so they build it that way you know the old-fashioned way by hand so there's no kind of magic framework that just automatically caches queries for you yet I didn't talk about a service that we call CVS for the computer data service one of the as the the essence lacks backronym all right so after slack was founded our founder Stewart Butterfield made up the acronym searchable link to archive of company knowledge but honestly slack was just a cool name and that was plausible backronym for it but haven't talked about search at all yet we do search and it involves search quality and that involves the sort of usual pipeline of search quality tools and m/l models and weights for linear models and things like that are currently provided by the cdf thing over a thrift interface we're using it for more and more things it's the bridge between sort of stuff that we have to construct in our data warehouse in a batch way and real time services I didn't talk to you but you are rate limiting a lot of it there are lots of little pieces of this picture that I drew where if you poke them hard enough really terrible things will happen so a lot of those things are guarded by if you know some version of a finger and the wind for what's a reasonable rate to use them at and if we start exceeding that we shed load and start alerting people and by the way the quick back the quick version of the the nickel sketch of the solar infrastructure is that we use solar its power and search those search indices are updated in real time by job queue jobs because solar itself sometimes is sticky and sometimes gets under load and it's team partitioned which is a complicated choice but it sort of fits in a framework of lots of the other team partitioning choices we'll be talking about so feel free to press me on this if you're curious about more later so there are bunch of cool things that fall out of this the way that we've built slack so far one of the unifying themes that's a little unusual if you're coming from sort of a scale out consumer-oriented backend is that there's been team prove it partitioning as a pretty pervasive decision and as long as teams are sort of the dimension you're scaling along right as long as that's kind of how you're growing this works really well this lets you scale teams really really easily so if you ever go to slack comm and you sign up for a team we're essentially provisioning an instance of this little box in Aero diagram I keep showing right we find you some shard to fit your team on we slap it there we find some message server that seems to have some spare capacity we just tell you that's the message server that you're going to be using we write a row out to the mains that says hey this team exists here's its domain name here's its name and a few other sort of pieces of metadata pointers to which shard and message server shard and so on it uses and we're golden and you know slack unlike a lot of the a lot of sort of recent hot mass adoption consumer products we actually charge our customers right people actually pay us money and so this is actually a fairly nice layer of indirection to have from that point of view right if you have an angry customer who you know probably is angry because there's such great users of your product right they're probably angry because they use you a lot or they have a lot of users I was having a bad time of things being able to just say okay we'll put you on some nice fire-breathing platinum coated hardware is a nice economically viable store decision to make okay so let me critique this not all is is roses for us right now we have a number of challenges like everybody else and a lot of these challenges do arise from sort of some decisions that we made in this architecture so we'll walk through a few scenarios or on the system that I've just outlined which is and this isn't like some weird punchline by the way like that really is how slack works so I'll walk you through a few scenarios that are difficult to deal with with this kind of infrastructure the means you might have wondered why I mentioned them it seemed like sort of a kind of detail you might want to skip there a database there they're a pair of databases but they're still a database and terrible things can happen to them and they turn out to be a single point of failure I've been talking about RTM start a lot and emphasizing how it's this really big bulky thing that kind of tells you everything you need to know about your team that turns out to be really messy for large teams if you are a thousand people who share an office together and the people doing sewer work on the street outside your office today happen to cut through your fiber line and people get things working again at 3:00 p.m. and all thousand of you try to reconnect at the same millisecond that also turns out to be really difficult for this infrastructure to handle and just sort of diving into this some more you might think well you know the man's sure like it seems like a single point of failure logically but their two physical machines what's the big deal it's true that if one of the mains fails its partners gonna take over if both if both of them fail well we've wrapped a lot of memcache around these things so certain number of people are still going to be able to login but as soon as they're down the set of people who are actually able logging to slack is sort of dwindling quickly so if you're not a hidden memcache for your team's row from the mains slacks essentially down for you and this might sound really far-fetched because you know you've already sort of sustained one failure you said they're in two different data centers like why did the other one fail well you know how many people have had the experience of trying to sort of protect a system by replicating it and have the load be contagious right so those kinds of scenarios where the reason that one of them failed was because it was under too much load well now you have twice as much load on the other half and that one's probably not long for this world so this has happened the worst sort of outage in in terms of sort of affected users in slacks history was almost a year ago on November 23rd and was of 2015 and was an instance of mains failures so this is still something that keeps us up at night I talked about our team start sort of being big let me put a finer point on it it's not just big it's actually quadratic so as you add a new user to your team there is some probability that that user is also going to add a channel and that the users that are already there are going to join that channel so it turns out channel membership is naturally quadratic in team size right you sort of have a rectangle that's M channels high and end users high and it's moving up into the right getting bigger quadratically every time you add people to your team so if you're in a big team we're sending you a quadratic chunk of data when you start a session and this was sort of hard to notice initially just cuz the constant factors are pretty small but you start getting into the thousands and tens of thousands this becomes really noticeable and making this even worse as sort of that mastery connect scenario so imagine we do have thousands of people each of them doing these order of N squared RT M start operations there's kind of n cubed load on the system and this decision that we made of focusing teams on shards means that that n cubed load isn't spread across a nice ocean of sort of cloud capacity it's concentrated on that single pair of of databases that constitute this particular shards master master pair so we're just gonna lay down and die it's a bummer it turns out though it all ends here their jigs up if you guys like you know have a job for me I'm pretty smart I'm good at programming computers sometimes no no of course not of course not we're not giving up there don't worry never so with the mains we're very lucky so currently they're my sequel like everything else there's essentially another instance of that of that sort of my sequel master master pair of design pattern they do very simple queries against the mains and very simple updates against the mains it's almost the updates are almost always adding a row or modifying an existing row the queries are always point queries so you don't need some incredibly special properties or some incredibly strong properties from you know pick your favorite scale out storage engine to replace the mains with why hasn't happened already well it hasn't happened already in part because we've gotten really good at protecting the mains through a combination of memcache and the kind of rate limiting I was describing earlier but also because it's just a really hard thing to change when we finally kind of work up the nerve to do this it's going to be a very difficult and delicate operation to do it in a way that doesn't actually take all of slack down and we have ideas about how to do that of course you know well you know T the rights and double-reed and do you know run the whole playbook for how you deploy stateful services that are scary it just hasn't bubbled to the top of our list of priorities yet a little more to say about our team start for large teams so first of all partly incremental work has just been astonishingly successful at this so even though there's this like bummer kind of big o story about it being quadratic the actual distribution of latency is here is not unacceptable p95 is around 221 milliseconds right so barely perceptible p95 is you know well over half a second but we're not you know with that N squared there you might think that there are people sitting there you know growing old while they try to connect to slack and that doesn't seem to be happening mostly and we're in the process right now of actually changing the story around the client architecture I've been telling you right so instead of having a complete view of the we're in the process of migrating all of our clients and there's several of them and they're in different code bases to be able to understand a partial view and give you separate api's that let you do partial queries of channel membership and I'm using the channel membership example that's really easy to understand but that kind of quadratus it e as you add users keeps popping up in lots of natural places my fairy example this is just emojis right so slack lets you add custom emojis you can name an emoji give it a little 32 by 32 thing it might even be animated and it's relatively natural as teams grow to like go through this life cycle where they kind of have emoji bloat and then some administrator decides to clamp down on it or some sort of no fun person says hey this is work why do we have all these like animated emojis of parrots and but until you reach that point like emojis are also one of these kind of quadratic things and I spent a bunch of time looking at emoji performance when I first started back in January and then I masse reconnects I'm I get to introduce a new service that we're calling flannel and I keep trying to come up with some like clever name for what the what flannel means like some sort of pun on channel or like maybe like Spanish you know Mexican desserts like the flan or something we've got nothing it's just named flannel I'm sorry and what is it well flannel is a nap level as an application aware edge cash right so it's an edge cash that let's unpack that it's a cash so it has some of the information that we need to start and run these real-time operations it knows about slack or it's specific to slack it's not some generic thing it's not operating on sort of arbitrary restful things or something it knows that the thing that it's trying to do is accelerate slack connections and sessions and we don't necessarily run it that close to the data center we're running it on you know hopefully nice gear with good network connectivity but we'd like to be able to run this you know in a closet that we're renting from somewhere far around the world hopefully so I sort of before a picture of the real time part of the stack looked like this and we're in the process of changing its that it looks a little more like this so a couple of observations about this first of all this looks like a really silly change to be making right I've added a hop in a layer of indirection presumably we have to pay money for those computers you know why are we happy about that well that layer of indirection is doing a couple of things for us first of all it's keeping load off of the actual web back-end so if a lot of the functions that sort of RT M start used to take up are now happening when you connect to flannel we're actually able to serve that you know in a way that scales out a little more straightforwardly you notice there's two of them right so we can actually scale edge capacity for flannel separately from scaling the back end all right so we don't actually have to make some big painful migration to scale out all the shards for instance right we don't have to find you know we don't have migrated to MongoDB or something like that which would actually be a challenge by the way I didn't kind of get too deep into this but we really do use sequel the database engine does work for us we're actually relying on the query planner to be smart there are joins and stuff right we're not using it like a document store so being able to cache the application level results of that throw closer to the user it logically provides a nicer place to scale out a little bit and this is not all pie in the sky I did an engineering blog posts like back in spring about how we were planning to do this at that time we were calling flannel slack D it's in its creator since then it's actually gotten started on it want to call it flannel so we're calling it flannel and this this thing actually exists so slacks internal team the team that we actually all live off of all 650 slack employees are using it there are a few other teams that were using it for because it sort of addresses really critical problems that they're experiencing and with any luck it's coming to you real soon now as a version of these slides that's kind of was premature and jinx did so but this is not sort of a you know sometime in 2017 when we get to it this is real code that we're in the process of sort of figuring out how we're gonna deploy okay then so let's take a little breath here think about some of the things we learned it pains me to highlight this but of course there's a lot going on that I wasn't able to go into here I'd be incompetent to answer a lot of interesting questions about the client technology but we do have clients and they're complicated software to you know if you look at sort of the distributed system that is slack in terms of the number of cores the amount of storage use the number memory you know the flops the bandwidth the vast majority of it is in phones and laptops not in computers that we operate or write you know are able to administer we do voice calls there's a whole bunch of infrastructure on the back end to make voice calls work well and a bunch of Technology and clients also to make voice calls work well and there were a bunch of interesting trade-offs there I haven't told you how we backing this stuff up how any of this information ends up in a data warehouse I very briefly thumbnail sketch search Ivan talk about how we deploy code we do that about 40 times a day to the web application and the infrastructure that supports that and lets us do that with confidence and lets us convince ourselves that we're not breaking tests and that you know the core workflows inside of slack still work with all those changes to enable that kind of high velocity is is itself very interesting monitoring alerting is also a critical part of running slack so you know there's a really rich kind of smorgasbord of stuff that I could be talking about but it seemed like the the interest gauge for people who want to talk to me about slack are usually more interested in sort of this basic kind of you know what is the 100,000 foot picture view of it but there are many many careers worth of stuff to learn and do and problems to solve here so we did the hundred thousand foot view as promised we talked a little bit about our big PHP monolith and why you shouldn't hold that against us if you are currently inclined to we talked about the unusual way we use my sequel well we've kind of used my sequel to make an eventually consistent store that's highly available for rights under failure talked about how our real-time stack works and how we defer work we talked about a bunch of challenges we faced a lot of them around sort of how slow reconnects are and RTM start and the fact that failures and reconnections are often correlated in time and we need to handle that and we got to explain a little bit about flannel which is a big part of our solution to that story so this is work in progress there's a lot to do there's contact info for me on the slide obviously like you know I would be remiss if I didn't mention that we're hiring and with that I thank you for your time I'd be happy to take questions okay so if anyone has questions please raise your hand and then we'll hand out Mikey all right what happens when you get the third data center how was the active active and replication work in that case yeah so one of the interesting things about this master master thing is there's actually no obvious way to go from N equals 2 to N equals 3 and the answer is that is one of the like bridges that we actually need to cross so a current possible answer to this is that we just sort of go more conventional route and do master/slave so maybe there is a right head data center and writes just have to make their way back to the right capital of the world maybe we can have that right be per shard and we try to make it so that you know you're geographically close to the right head for your for your particular shard I could speculate we haven't really built it yet but it's a solid observation that there's not a totally obvious way to sort of make the master master stuff work if you're thinking why can't you just kind of make a ring of three and say you know here's a B and C a replays to B be replaced to CC replays to a it turns out that doesn't work and and ask your local my sequel expert if you're curious about why okay so the bin logs don't get replayed so they don't echo forever so you the one from a doesn't make it to C thanks for this great presentation I have a question about how do you handle hot spot for your charts yeah great so the question is how do you handle hot spots for your shards currently we handle it by alerting and having people scramble to split or shard the top and if that doesn't work we we handle it by paying for even fancier hardware to run the shard on and by hiring you know hopefully smart people like yourself to come work for us and come up with a solution that's going to work better and be more automated and hopefully not break everything about the application in the process does that answer your question all right honesty yes so smoking so you didn't think about security so lots of teams shared lots of documents through slack and maybe some confidential information like bats or and stuff like that so how do you make sure that these information lies in your servers and only our team acts as these service not only even your team can have access to these data even if they're wise to see my sequel database or the encrypted message if you encrypt them there's my first question my same question I know that you won't slack to replace the normal email flows between the team so I had this case that one of our team members just left the team and all the information that he wrote to us including descriptions conversations documents that he shared with the team is gone how would that replace the email if it's gone okay that's those are a couple interesting questions the first one said I should say by the way that I'm like not an actual InfoSec professional so my understanding of this stuff is especially secondhand in amateurish however one of the advantages of sort of the team charting approach that we didn't go into too deeply here is that it does make attempts at intrusion a little more legible right so it does make sort of attempts to exfiltrate a team's data or something a little easier to see one of the things that we're is a little opaque from the outside that we're more careful about than some of then I think some of our competitors is that people don't have access to the production environment right I don't have access to the production environment I don't have the you know I can't run queries against the production my sequel shard there is you know glass I can break in case of emergency that enables me to do that for instance but that's obviously heavily audited and the people in our security team have tooling that they refuse to tell me about that they claim is keeping that stuff on lockdown and that's kind of one of the things that's different about a paid product that we're asking people to trust their company's information with in the case the second one where my understanding is basically you're saying that somebody left the team and they kind of took all their information with them when they left the team that is not how I understand the product to be supposed to work right so when when users disappear they still kind of have an identity the product and things like your DM threads with them should still be there files they created should still be there to the best of my understanding and share it in the same places but if you have a repro of this and if you're able to share any details at all you know hit me up and I'll try and dig into what actually happened there one more question great presentation thank you our engineers like engineers happy with PHP so it depends on the engineer the question if you didn't hear it is our slack engineers happy with PHP so it depends on the engineer right and so I'm coming from like 7 years at Facebook so I of course like feel like this is you know the old sword right this is I know exactly what the what the scary parts are and exactly how to use it so it doesn't break when you're coming to it new there's a bunch of things that are actually that are actually surprising I think by and large once they've adapted to our code base in our conventions we're using it well I think most probably wouldn't say they love PHP the programming language but they sure like deploying 40 times a day and it turns out that's there those two are sort of fundamentally in tension in an interesting way so I'll sell my blog post again if you don't mind if you look for taking PHP seriously everyone for coming and another round of applause for you\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: we should talk about something that many of you heard already but this is a deep type for all the companies that want to use slack so let's deep dive into that if you don't know this chair my name is Chris of Magnuson and the founder of the company called blackboard and we deal with new work and digital transformation every day we have lots of clients who use these tools we help them to implement it but more important it changes the way you work so I have four things to share number one is like what you need to do if you bring such a tools the company that's very important and many companies underestimate that number two is how you like customized it for you personally like what should you do what is our experience what is our best practice from customers how do you use it in the daily usage like what do you actually want to see that it's like is 4 and then the fourth thing like how do you continuously improve what you have been doing with analytics and what you see these four things let's work through them so one thing don't forget to subscribe we do a lot of these videos and we put a lot of effort in them I'm a filmmaker at heart I'm just CEO by profession so make sure you subscribe and turn on the notifications first of all if you look at slack or any of these kind of tools many companies come to us and say we want to replace the email and that is a mistake in the objectives you have on it because this tool is not just a replacement for an email it changes the whole way you work and if you think of the term new work one of the most important things you can achieve in a company is transparency to give people the freedom to make their own adult grown-up decisions on if they want to like take part in it or not so this transparency is very important we are here in our new office studio space which is an open space and it's the same like if you move to a new office you have to like take your people along so when you bring such a tool to the company you should be aware that it changes the way how your people work the behavior the daily culture that you bring to the company the leadership will become more transparent so you have to take your leaders along and show them like how it's changing in the way you react and also your people have to then react to what the leaders say and this is very uncommon for many companies that want to change the way they work this is why you have to take your people along have to tell the story you have to make clear that the goal is to change the way you work so what do you do to customize this like account I need a laptop thank you so much well if you don't know this guy yet everyone in this channel oh this is MP behind the camera so you will hear him because we just occupy this empty studio space here for the very first video so as I said we just share our best practice experience of like what user most likely things you can add so if you have anything that you're missing edit in the comments and we will comment on that and share as well the experience I have course cannot share too many like details of customer projects but I will give you the overview that you need so first of all what you see here is it's like you have the chance to star a certain channel so everything is built in channels and if you scroll through here you see that most of our channels are public just very very few needed ones I think true that we really need yeah - that we really need or just private and this is the most important thing you implement this tool to add transparency to the company like in an open space and this transparency helps you to like make your own decisions to like jump in a certain work and like to bring transparency just the whole company and help people to make your own decisions if you close all the channels because you see how this is just for a certain group it becomes difficult of course if your company of like a thousand of five thousand please you cannot have every channel public you will have certain teams so typical team is then something between let's say 5 - maybe like 30 people that's not very often that team is bigger and that's a good size and slack the productivity decreases if the team gets bigger than that but the rule of thumb is that at least at least more than 80% of the channels should be transparent I used to say like 60 70 percent but I would say these days with experience 80 percent plus should be in transparency channels on the other side texting people directly and the one on one message is down here is the same thing as like shopping emails into 90 pieces so you also don't want to do that anything that is related to a project should be in a public channel and if you want to mention someone you should only mention the person of the channel every explodes it what we did to like give the chance a certain overview you see the internal channels for blackboard with a BB in the front so you can actually see what are our internal channels on top anything like fun stuff is very important of course the content stuff that we do is very important but there's many other things that are internally typically you set up a channel for certain project and you like archive it whenever you don't need it anymore and then we have the customer related channel state and they are added with a see here and as you can see we use just short names for customers so that we can talk about customers in public space that we can be on the phone in a train and talk about a certain company without everyone knowing what we're talking about so we have that in slack that you're reminded of that and we actually mirrored that to tools like G Drive where we have exactly the same initials for any customer so you can connect these two since you can also connect at Internet that's like the key structure to slack the three channels I think every company needs we call it D lager fun stuff and good news the loggers actually like your daily briefing for the president like the loggers from the military it's worth it in the German army use the log of expression for like what is happening and we do that every morning before nine o'clock the content team is sometimes a bit late but the rest of the company is before nine o'clock and then this channel gives you an overview of what is happening today which is super important if not everyone is at the same spot which and most of the companies not everyone is so in a few words you say like what is happening what am i doing and you see something funny like you call our colleague here from Hamburg says she's in Dusseldorf and then for a workshop for a company and as you see here we always use client code names as I said so I don't know the company but I can click in here I can see the replies what people said to that success or was it because I'm a bit later and reply to that and I could jump to the channel and see what is this project about and now I remember okay I've seen that that's pretty cool interesting client we see videos pictures and so on so there is already a lot of stuff happening I go back to the lag and see that Antonia of course saw that and was just pointing upward with an emoji so she's doing the same thing and then I see my colleague Catherine from Berlin stay focus workshop with all new colleague so this is super fast in like having an overview of what is everyone doing in the company and like how is the company but feeling like today I highly recommend this channel to everyone and work with that you also see like two times call I will explain it later and like I'm on the road so what's app and then questionnaires and so on everyone in the companies in the channel and you cannot leave that channel actually you have to stay in the channel fun stuff is super important I like to laugh with your colleagues I mean what you want to do in office you want to cry you want to celebrate you want to laugh all these different things so fun stuff is very important to like be reminded of that all this problem-solving that you usually do with these kinds of tools like emails and writing and typing also you need fun stuff and good news is a bit different good news is something that is project related that is not funny where you don't make jokes but it's a like we're in the press we have a success with a new client and so on then you share as well of course there are other examples that you find here like kpi's we have something for the managing directors we have jobs and so on there are many channels you typically can use in a company but the intensity that we use it in I would say these channels are the most important ones for everyone and then of course the client channels that you actually work in the other customization that you can do I would say it's more related to anything you edit the background like which apps do you want to have to select which integrations do you want to like give it a bit of your own color and not the typical slate color and so on it's important you can also like add your own emojis and gifts and stuff like that but we will talk about it second this is actually the most important stuff you can do anything the background I would say it's easy to click through the settings and it's pretty self-explanatory what you can do there second part like how do you use it in your daily work and this is something that like if you're a bit too stuck to the serious business email thing then it might feel uncomfortable in the beginning but if you know that there are certain people for example whatsapp they always start with a long introduction so on but if you know these tools I would say you never feel disconnected so you don't have to always start with a very formal hello my dear friend how are you and so on so you are short it's the most important thing but to add emotion to your shortness you need emojis so I'm a big fan of emojis and gifts and react geez which will explain a second that it helps you to like very fast but still give it a little bit of emotion to what you wanted to say so emojis you put in here and you can of course like Tony I did that in like this morning just add two emojis to initiate what you're doing which is quite funny here my team is using the fire emoji a lot I don't know why but I use it a lot so that's maybe why and you can add your own emoji so and peacebuilding continuous emojis with me being angry all the time I don't know why so he suggested why don't we like built me being happy so now we have a mark happy emoji which is I think a great innovation at blackboard and then you have react G's which is the emojis below a certain post and help you to like quickly to react to something here we did a questionnaire that we want to make a new G sweeper's office 365 movie we have the top movies on YouTube already but we want to stay with that and we were asking who wants to be in the G sweet side and the company and he wants to be on the office 365 site so we headed to emojis for that and now you can react to the post with G suite or office our own emoji or we can react with mark thinking oh my god like that I don't know if you think it's funny I think it's funny it's this fun stuff to the company second super important thing if you know blackboard on the other videos or you can look that up we explain that the more emotional topic the more sinfulness of communication and the awesome Chrome is communication like this is very difficult to bring up emotions and I was talking to Tess on my PA this morning and asked her hey like why don't you share a bit more of what you're doing currently because there's a lot of stuff to do as you can see we use a YouTube integration here to share videos because it's like like two things that are not so good you cannot have voice messages like in whatsapp which I'm a big fan of because it indicates the emotion of the other person and the second thing is video we use a lot of video to like indicate like how do I feel about a project did something go wrong is something good happening and it's so easy to just take your smartphone camera mine's laying over there now but you can just quickly record the video and then upload it and share that but there is no good video player and slack if you use it on desktop it's pretty okay but if you're on the road which most of the people are all the time it's not as good so we have a private YouTube channel that is hidden nothing super crazy is on there like internal stuff and as I said if we talk about client projects we always talk about the initials but not the client names so nothing crazy can happen so people are taught like how to use it and now I could play even if I'm on the road this video from Tessa like get an idea of what she's currently working on and she did that in like of course phone mode so because most of the people watch it on the phone and now everyone could see and then react to that if they want I think it's a pretty nice thing Thank You Tessa for making that video if you have stuff like let's say I write a client name instead of using client initial and we think of the name that is public think of something mine loosely make sure you always use the customer names with Valhalla and here we have the list of short names of the customer so we use the slack bot to help us with certain things like you can tell the slack pot if you type certain words or stuff like that it can send you a document and it's sometimes helpful for people if they've got something and even how forget it from time to time tonight not mention the client this is a bike everyday use what we use a lot are like gifts in reactions like of course you know that from many other apps you can use it in Microsoft teams as well but we use a lot of gifts to react to things what else to say about the use I think you will definitely see the difference if you use it in daily communication that the transparency is changing a lot in the behavior of your people that's definitely one big thing and the other thing is you will recognize like if you don't replace email but you start working here in the project that after a vacation it's just a few clicks so like scroll through a project to get an overview because we make sure in like every day that we never give tasks in slack so we never give you a task and you have to like run after that and the second thing is if there is a seven indicating up here like a small number this example here's one I know for sure I was mentioned in the channel and it's not that you were mentioned all the time as a channel but your mention is a person so I know if I don't have a lot of time today I look at these seven threats that are unread which is loading now and now I can check how was it give a minute I have have to eat something okay good then a new comic was working on something he was asking me can you give me feedback so you see that's a link to a Google Doc we never upload hard documents like we always use links to Google or any think external debt this is not the source but this is just bringing the communication together big mistake many companies do they load the actual content in here and this is them the main source we always make sure this is just the communication tool that glues everything together so I open that for giving for the day later some feedback there is a good request on that came on Facebook actually and pic here that's a good example speaking requests came in on facebook on my page I didn't see that and P saw it and P positive to slack if Tessa has seen it Tessa was taking phone call of them I mean this is the power of slack in a team this is how it's usually working okay what do I have to add here like for the daily usage one things integrations so we integrate asana for the tasks so if there are tasks related to a project and that are actually completed you would see it here in an update let me see there's something maybe here for certain client yeah lisanna task as analyst da here you see they're like if there's something related to this project of GUI gie and it has been completed then I see it here and I could go to a sauna because the sauna is the two where we actually didn't give us the tasks and for the content team we have an integration that is called socials which indicates me on frame IO our tool that there is a new hop load I don't know why it's not loading here in this case but usually you see the picture of the video here and it shows you ok there's something new that's what it's for these are the integrations and the other things that are important is we have to I would say levels of escalating stuff one is we have a whatsapp group for the whole company so everyone at blackboard can be reached with like one message what step because what's it is a very personal very private tool we never misuse this group this is used for I have lost my device like you use like you call someone else and they texted a group or there has been a breach or email as often or whatever and we have a channel that is in a totally completely different world what's it was working with Facebook slack is running on the Amazon service Google is working on the Google service so we always have something that we can keep on communicating which we think is very important and there were times when we had to use that and other thing is our two times call rule so whenever it's a real emergency you would never ever go through this channel you would always call two times in a row always and this helps you to like free yourself from looking all the time everywhere chapter 4 how do you continuously improve slack and what do you do with the analytics we talk every eight weeks about if we use this tool in the right way put improvements to the tool we live there we breathe in it and we challenge it one thing we do is we show the numbers let me see the numbers the analytics all right so if you are the owner of a channel and if you are the guy who actually like looks at the communication I always liked G suite and also slack and other tools that give me certain statistics of how are my people communicating not because I say like I want to control it but to me the amount of communication especially the transparent communication indicates to me how healthy the company is communication is the glue that keeps everything together like that makes a team strong so looking at statistics is super important and it's like you can see like how many members you have of course in this team like this is always looking at one team and then you can see how active this week the people are the public channels as I said we have 101 public channels and you can also see how public and how private the communication is that's what I've told you like you want more than eighty percent of communication to be public better more than 90 percentage so we're usually not too often below this 80 percent rule as I said which is super important it indicates to us like how open are we in the company and how easy it is to get information the rest is direct messages private channels SEC super low so this is just people chatting at certain days which usually is fine and like tech support you don't want to like deal with certain people in like public channels because you say like hey this is too much going back and forth so you say hey let's take this offline to a private conversation the other thing is you of course and this is something people discuss a lot is of course which are the most active channels but also like who are the most active members and I know this is politically not correct or anything but still if you say you know what we want to have a certain ranking of what we're doing and we want to like help people to like get better you can say who was very active in the last 30 days for example I was on vacation so luckily it's not me being the number one but for example today is super active like he's new and he is always very fast and all that Neil's beat me definitely of the time I was on vacation just had like hundred and thirty-four messages and you can like see worship he like help with more communication certain teens and as I said like if you want to know like what is like a new very interesting channel you also can see okay is there something happening that I maybe missed out that is important to me this looks like a new client channel this is something from the websites there's something happening so this always helps indicate it and we share that throughout the meetings not all too often publicly enough for the company but we want to like bring more frequency in it but we also share our monthly numbers so stuff like that it's definitely interesting because communication is what makes a company interesting and good and fast and successful what else to add just like integrations as I said there are many integrations so you have to configure in the apps that that you want to integrate there's so many apps it's very hard to like go through all of them but almost everything is possible to integrate to stake it's more important to like think if you need that to like not give it an overkill but this is best practice from I would say if you like boil it down to the most important things that we've seen with clients starting with slack Microsoft teens is a bit different in the setting so I now think of we should add a second video related to Microsoft teams because that's the other big tool at the moment in the workplace in many companies that decided to like work with Microsoft that case and you know that's pretty much it any questions you would like to have put it to the comments below and I'd be thrilled really thrilled if you subscribe to this channel here turn on the notifications down there because YouTube changes all the time and you miss out a video if you don't turn it on and if you're not convinced yet there is another video recommended by the artificial intelligence of YouTube that you should watch thanks guys and I see you next week for sure\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: today I'm going to show you how I built cyber Jeff a slack app that helps me automate things that I would otherwise have to do manually for members of our slack channel if you're not already in our slack you should join with a link in the description it's a great way to communicate and you can chat with me personally along with a bunch of other developers working on a similar stack if you're already a pro member you should be summoned by cyber Jeff he's a faster and more reliable version of me when you first join the slack Channel he'll check to see if your email has a matching account in the firestore database with pro status if there's a match he'll invite you to our Pro Channel and tell you how to redeem a sticker and t-shirt now this is a very personalized slack app for my business needs but in today's video I want to show you how to build your own from scratch if you're new here like and subscribe and check out the full write-up on fire ship IL now before you start building a slack app you should start by outlining your actual use case because their API is absolutely massive it allows you to automate things within the workspace create chat BOTS interactive UI elements and a whole bunch of other things but if you're a developer there are two main reasons you would build a slack app in the first place companies already using slack may want to enhance some sort of internal process or communication flow that's essentially what cyber chat is it's mostly an automation tool but also serves as our new AI overlord on slack the other reason you might want to build a slack app is to build a service to be consumed by other slack users black has a public directory for third-party apps all you have to do is build something useful marking it well and you'll have enterprise clients throwing money at it in no time let's go ahead and get started you'll need two things for this project you'll need some kind of slack workspace that you have admin access to and then we'll be using firebase as our service back-end with cloud functions but feel free to use whatever nodejs back-end you prefer the first thing we'll do is create a new slack app you can do this from the slack API home page and you'll see a big button there to create a new app now like I said before the API is massive so you kind of need to know what you're building before you get started some apps might want to listen and react to events that happen within the work space while others might want to fetch or post information into it like post new messages and things like that or in our case a combination of both we want our server to listen to the slack event of when a new users added to a channel and then react to it by posting a new message into the slack workspace if you're not sure which API you actually I would highly recommend following this flowchart provided by slack now getting back to the slack admin panel let's enable events events are essentially outbound web hooks that allow you to listen to events that happen within the slack workspace or events triggered by a bot in our case we only care about one event which is the member joint channel event we simply select that from the drop-down and then you'll notice it's asking us for a request URL this URL will be an HTTP firebase cloud function but before we can use it we need to verify that we actually own it with slack so you can see right now it's currently unverified let's go ahead and open up the S code and then we'll open a terminal session and run firebase and net functions I'll be using the typescript flavor for this video to show you some of the caveats there but feel free to use vanilla JavaScript if you prefer now let's go ahead and get our endpoint verified all we need is an HTTP cloud function this function will receive a challenge parameter from the request body sent by slack we simply receive the challenge parameter and then send it back as the response now let's go back to the terminal and run firebase deploy after a minute or so that should deploy the function and give us back our functions URL go ahead and copy and paste that value as the slack request URL you should immediately get a green check mark so now that the endpoint is verified it's time to build something useful we need to make sure that our app is fully secure and there's a couple of steps involved in that depending on the types of api's that you plan on using now back to the terminal for our cloud function will install the slack web api along with google cloud pub/sub and i'll explain why that's needed in a few minutes slack provides a big mono repo with a bunch of different packages the web api is used if you want to post messages into slack or modify things in the work space in order to use it in a work space we need to authenticate it with an OAuth token the token is unique to the work space and not the app itself so each workspace that has this app installed will have a different auth token since this is a private app installed in a single workspace we'll simply install it which will take us directly to the OAuth tokens for the team you'll want to copy this value and then head over to the command line once again and we'll set it up as an environment variable in the cloud functions environment by running firebase functions config set token equals roo token and that's the only credential you need for the slack web api but our app is also listening to incoming events from slack so we need a way to verify that those requests are actually legitimate because it's possible for a hacker to send fake requests to our cloud function URL we can prevent that by going to the basic information page and grabbing our sign-in secret we'll also use the firebase functions config set command to add this as an environment variable now validating the signing secret from scratch is kind of a pain so I actually put together a dedicated snippet on fire ship IO just for this purpose slack has an events API package that can do some of this for you automatically but it doesn't really work well in a service environment all we have to do is perform timing save string comparison using double hash message authentication code which of course is something that every programmer should know how to do with their eyes closed you'll see a more detailed description in the snippet but basically we're taking our signing secret and then comparing it to a signature that slack provides in the header if the final values match then we know we have a ballot request otherwise we reject it now let's get on with the actual code implementation of the slack app we'll go ahead and import the web client from slack Web API then we'll initialize the client using the slack token that we saved to the functions environment then we'll also instantiate Google pub sup here so let me take a second to explain why we need pub/sub if you're not familiar with it it's a service that allows you to pass messages between different Google cloud services so it's very similar to HTTP but it's fully secure within the Google cloud infrastructure now the slack API requires that their initial request is responded to within 3,000 milliseconds or three seconds if you don't respond within that time you'll get a timeout error and then slack will try to retry that same endpoint if your app has a long-running back-end process like it makes API requests to some other API then you'll need to queue up some type of background job to handle that work outside of the 3,000 millisecond limitation and that's exactly what our pub/sub function will do so that means the only responsibilities of the HTTP function is to verify the signature and then queue up the background job we can do that by stringify in the initial request body converting it to a buffer then using the pub sub client to publish to a specific topic using that buffer so essentially what this does is it takes the request body and then passes it off to a pub sub function that we can handle in the next step and lastly make sure to send a response to slack with a 200 status code so what we've done here is passed off all the heavy lifting to a pub sub function which has no time limitation so feel free to take as long as you want to handle it we can set up the cloud function making sure to point to the same topic that we publish to the on publish callback will give us access to the message which has the same data contained in the original request body the data that's available here depends entirely on the type of event that stripe has sent to your back-end you'll need to mostly reference the stripe API Docs because even though we're in typescript it doesn't provide typing's for the actual response data types when a new user is added to a channel it will give us an event which we can access on the message JSON and then we can grab the user and the channel from that event so that gives us a user ID and a channel ID from slack in this implementation we only want to run the code if the user is being added to the general channel for the first time if that's not the case we can throw an error or just return null from the function now the first thing we want to do is take that user ID and grab the full user profile which will contain the email address and display name of that user on slack we can do that by making a request with bot users profile get that will give us a Web API response and the actual data we want is on the result profile and that's an unknown type so we'll go ahead and cast it to any so we can destructor the properties on it now before we go any further we'll need to make sure that our bot has the proper permission to read a user's profile you can set up permissions or scopes for your bot on the admin area for the slack app you'll want to use the principle of least privilege here and only grant access to the actual operations that your bot needs to do its job now that we have the users email address we could make a query to fire store to grab that actual user record from the database but I think we should just stick to the slack API for this demo we'll go ahead and invite that user to a new channel then have the bot send them a direct message with some text that welcomes them to the new channel and that's basically all there is to it we now have a fast and secure server olace back-end for building our slack but there's a lot more we can do beyond this simple use case if you want to build a full-blown conversational bot consider using something like dialogue flow it makes it super easy to build BOTS that have human-like conversations similar to the Google assistant or Alexa and you can add it to your slack channel with just a few button clicks and if you want to make the responses from the app more interactive with buttons and images and things like that check out block kit it's a UI framework specifically for slack I'm gonna go ahead and wrap things up there if this video helped you please like and subscribe and consider becoming a pro member at fire ship

            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: hey welcome everyone to another session of experience week this is super exciting because we're talking about product experience today I'm Ryan Smith co-founder and CEO of Qualtrics and I have the pleasure of sitting down with Stewart Butterfield founder and CEO of slack how are you Stewart I'm well thank you first before we get started Stewart talk let's talk about where slack came from how you came up with the idea this isn't your first rodeo you created a well-known product called Flickr mm-hmm very few entrepreneurs can do it once let alone twice so if you just take us through the origin of you know Flickr and then and then slack and and why we're here all right well so the bad news is that they're close to impossible to replicate both are kind of pivots from failed massively multiplayer games so it's kind of thing I think if you start off with the intent to build a failed massively multiplayer game you may not end up with a product like this but there's something common to both of those failed games Flickr and slock and that comes from an experience I had 25 years ago so it's 1992 it's my first year college one of the things we had to do is go down to the basement computer lab in the Claire hue building at the University of Utah RIA and get our accounts on the school's UNIX machine so I got that and there's a couple years before the web or maybe a year and a half before the web really took off so the things on the internet were using a talk IRC email and it could use email to talk to two friends who had gone off to different colleges but using that kind of just blew my mind this directory of news group topics kind of like a bulletin board and this was like 90% of the traffic on the internet in the days before the web in fact rock music G dead or the Grateful Dead discussion group was like the Netflix of its time was like 40% of Internet traffic and the thing that was so exciting to me was the use of computing technology to facilitate human interaction which was kind of really brand-new that you could transcend geography that you could could you know transcend the the way in which you grew up and find these people who could be in different time zones on different continents but shared the same interests as you so may not seem connected but over the next couple years when the webs came to prominence I taught myself HTML I got a job as a web designer in the first days of blogging I was really avid you know maybe from 99 through 2002 or something like that and all this early online community the kind of birth of social software you know now we're at the point where everyone has these fancy phones in their pocket you can communicate with anyone on the surface of the planet literally at the speed of light and what are we gonna do with that technology so we as a again as a species kind of stumbling our way trying different things experimenting I think we're still in the really early stages so when I say we wanted to try and make a game I think what people think is that you or like a guy with the sword fighting a dragon or something like that this was much more taking those early virtual communities and putting them into the context to play really collaborative a lot of social interaction one world that was shared and the point of the game was gonna have to evolve the world there's a book by the theologian James course called finite and infinite games and the first line of the book at them paraphrasing a little bit but there are two kinds of games one is played for the purpose of winning those are finite games and then infinite game is which are played for the purpose of continuing the play so that was really our inspiration turns out a little bit hard to explain a little bit lofty not super commercially viable so especially in 2002 which is when we started the first company sure you know you remember this time he had the dot-com crash we had WorldCom and Enron the big accounting scandals 9/11 it was just like a disaster moment kind of black economy the Nasdaq had fallen eighty percent from its peak and no one wanted to fund anything on the Internet at all but especially not something whimsical like a game and we looked for something that week get to market quicker because the game was really complex and ambitious but that would take advantage of the technology we'd already developed that turned out to be Flickr and it's kind of a whole story there which we can gloss over got bought by Yahoo in 2005 myself and the whole team went to go work there and then 2009 beginning of the year I was out and three of those original Flickr team members still yeah all decided to leave and to start a new company to build a web-based massively multiplayer game this time we couldn't fail technology had advanced servers were really cheap compared to 2002 way more people online we were all better what we did there's all this great open-source software the network had spread you know from a couple people having dial-up at home dan more or less Vic witness broadband and failed again but we spent three and a half years on it and we had a really discipline across disciplinary team we had created people artists animators writers musicians and the one hand and then we had more traditional software development team back-end programming technical operations we had customer support business operations and we used one of those technologies that I first discovered back in 1992 IRC or Internet Relay Chat as the foundation for how we communicated at the company and IRC has this one fundamental concept called a channel and you send messages to the channel rather than to individuals or to groups of individuals as you do an email or most messaging systems and that's look it's a fundamental shift because the channel can exist before you arrive and it consists after you leave you can look into other channels across the system when you join the organization you know whether it's the next day or six months later or five years later all of that stuff is archived and not in all these different channels and we slowly over the course years built feature after feature solve the really irritating problems took advantage of the obvious opportunities and so fast forward now to 2012 and to the year it was apparent that the game wasn't gonna work like it just wasn't gonna be viable again it was never gonna be the kind of business they were just the 17 million bucks in venture capital investment we had raised but we all realized we would never work without a system like this one again and so thought that it might be something that the rest of the world would want and I still remember going to andreessen horowitz one of our investors and telling them this is what we're going to do and saying you know we think that there's a big market for this we think over the next 10 years that kind of at the fullness of time this could be a hundred million dollars in revenue and this could be a billion-dollar company and I'm sure they remember this different labor like whatever and we blew past that a couple years after launching so the demand has been much bigger than we would have thought and I think we've sort of accidentally discovered something that is theirs for which there's a lot of latent demand yeah it's really cool it's a fascinating story and I think it's one that a lot of people can can relate to just from how something great comes out of a pivot mm-hmm but I also think it takes a lot of a lot of guts and kind of willpower to be able to do that if you think about where slack is today what's what's most exciting from you know just for our audience to see the size and you know how do you Eddy yes so there are over six million daily active users nine million on a weekly basis little more than half 55% of those are outside of the US there is 50,000 paid teams around the world you have millions of people paying for it but when we say daily active users mean like you know people are logging in there every day because it's the kind of app that you you can't just check in on you know once in a while if you're not using it every day you're not really using it and when we think about the future obviously there's just more like there are hundreds of millions of people around the world who fall into the kind of sweet spot of knowledge work and they could be you know speaking English or some other language they could work in IT or legal or recruiting or finance or attack marketing and we barely scratch the surface there you know we're like over a couple percent of the way in and then the second thing it's not tends to replace the usage of email for internal communication it definitely doesn't that's not an email killer it doesn't get rid of email across organizational boundaries but when people hear that I think what comes to mind is you type some text into a box you hit the button and against sent over the internet and someone else can look at it but that's not all we use email for like email is this system of record it starts to do list it's the fundamental kind of security passport you can use to reset your password ever else it's the way you get receipts for all your transactions you take a ride and I left for you by Simon Amazon that's where your seat shows up it's friends and family it's invitations to events its unwelcome pitches from salespeople it's welcome pitches from salespeople it's newsletters you subscribe to marketing messages spam but inside a company really specifically it's the way all decisions get made it's like a way the job offer gets approved the budget is debated on setting direction for the company all the formal announcements you know we just hired a new executive or we bought a company or we're shutting down this division or whatever and all of that stuff move just lock including all of the credit column workflows you know which can be things as mundane as approving expense reports or putting in a ticket to IT for support because your laptops messed up all the way up to approving the contract for your biggest customer ever yeah I think look we've definitely seen that Aquatics where you know it's it's prevalent throughout all our organizations especially in engineering is we is we is we shift a little bit and talk about product itself mm-hmm you've had a lot of iterations I think the virality or the viral component of slack's been super impressive to a lot of people when you when you think about creative and product and you think about hiring how do you how do you actually think about those together I just came in on the on the wall I saw empathy and creative how does that all play out I've heard you talk about it before there's some same from Charles Eames architect and designer that the role of designer is that of a good host that way of thinking that the other people using your product are your guests is putting a very different mindset then you're like this creative genius in what you're doing is super important and the world just doesn't understand you and people should appreciate this because we've really just a 180 degree different attitude when we evaluate our own stuff versus when we use other people's software or experience other people's products it's not this thing where when you go to a restaurant website if you're anything like me you want the phone number the address the opening times or the menu and nothing else matters and yet no one makes restaurant websites that prioritize that stuff it's like this stupid music starts playing and there's like a slow Ken Burns pan over some pasta or whatever and you have to wait for that it to be done no one wants that experience for themselves and yet they feel like other people are gonna want it and that's a kind of the most exaggerated example I can find but we really tried to put ourselves in the position of our customers and you tried to hurt and techniques for that one that I'm not sure if it's truly effective or not but I've tried a lot with people is just try to imagine someone's heard about slack a couple times maybe they saw tweet about it I saw an ad that we put up and then someone recommended again it's the end of their day it's 9:00 p.m. they just put the kids to bed they're watching TV they lay back they go to the App Store and they install our app and we're just like not even in the top 1000 most important things in their lives you know like they have all these other concerns ambitions issues and we don't want to create an experience that is anything less than the most respectful it could be of their time imagine if you were designing this for yourself you don't care about the company at all just purely selfishly how would this work you know how would you be on board into the app how would the administrative features work how would you invite people how would you install applications into slack from our app directory it's a tough one for you know for whatever reason a lot of people have been trained up on techniques for like value extraction from customers as opposed to value creation for customers and you know our business and we want to make money but I really admire under cadet Leeson survivorship bias here but companies like Amazon where you're like we had 20-plus year focus um they're now twenty something years old they started making money a couple years ago and up to that point it was just creation of value and they're still relentlessly focused on how fast can the delivery happen how fast can the pages load how fast can an accurate can the search results be and those fundamentals are really critical and it's harder and harder to ensure that our focus remains on those as we get bigger and as we get more customers you get more demand some customers and more feature requests more input of just of all kinds and we almost as a point of religion try to keep ourselves as open to feedback as possible so expose as much of the company to like surface area of customers as we can so I don't know like I have no one magic trick there except for again focus you know that experience and imagining that this person using the software's is our guest they are more important than us we're trying to be of service to them and if we can truly create value there'll be plenty of opportunities for us to capture some of that down the road so most most people probably watching this are either with a really small company where it's really easy to be involved in all the details we've actually had this conversation before I remember a couple years ago you and I were talking about being involved in all the details on the product side but you just mentioned Amazon where as you get bigger and the challenges that we've gone through that you've gone through of scaling how do you make sure that you don't have product drift right or something that something that ends up different than you thought I don't think many people set out and say hey we want to build a product with a horrible experience but here we are surrounded by products that have a horrible experience so what's a couple tips that you have for creating that and maintaining that focus I think it's really remembering how much deliberate effort it takes and that can like literally be putting things on the wall so you saw some of these in there's a wall here but you know it's checklist techniques it's like here's the mantra where you repeat at the beginning of the meetings weekly or whatever it is to keep that foreground because when new people started slack I tell them the story I'm in Vancouver we have an office there I meet with our creative director for product design revenue one and one we're in this neighborhood in Vancouver where the sidewalks are really narrow and there's a lot of vendors have sandwich boards out on the sidewalk so you kind of got to go like this when you're walking down and it starts to rain and we don't have umbrellas but and most other people do maybe three-quarters or something like that and when people are walking towards us we noticed that very few of them move their umbrellas out of the way seems like the pokey thing was right like I level when we're walking down the street and we'd even have a joke we're talking about it and we're trying to predict like the next person would they move it out of the way or not and they didn't so one explanation and this is not the correct explanation because you should not attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance so one explanation is like if you don't have any avenues to exercise power in their life and so they're just like I'm gonna make you get out the way of my umbrella that's probably not you but what explanations remain so like one is they just don't notice they're walking down the street and despite the fact that they would inevitably live in a city like Vancouver have had this experience since allergy for where they didn't have the umbrella and someone else did they just don't see it or they see it and they're like I can't I don't know what I could do about this it's too bad but that's happening and that that person has to get out of the way of my umbrella but I'm you know I don't have any theories about what I could do to make that situation better when it's really look there's two options one is this you know like a hundredth of a calorie worth of effort in one little tiny muscle in your wrist and the other one is this but those two things will get the umbrella out of the way and I don't like thinking about the world this way because it's a little bit of a pessimistic view but most people didn't move their umbrellas other way so most people just don't see the problems or if they see the problems they don't see a solution to the problems and it's not like there's one class of humans who are geniuses and we'll see it every time and there's a bunch of morons and we want to make sure we only hire the geniuses we all have that tendency we all have that continuum we all have a focus on ourselves and our own priorities and our own needs when you mentioned something earlier around and it seems like there's a repetitiveness that has to go on to educate everyone around you know what we're focused on and kind of the the principles of great product great design you mentioned being a host mm-hmm right what what makes a good host in your mind if you're if you're hosting the product and you you actually view it as you're a steward over that experience what what makes that I mean I think it's it's pretty simple it eludes me not getting the result is simple but the the orientation is pretty simple which is thoughtfulness anticipating needs you one of my favorite examples of literally being a hostess if you have someone come in to stay at your house and some guests then you have a guestroom take the towels that you want them to use and put them on the bed yeah nicely folded so when they come in they're like oh I should use those towels rather than right into the bathroom and we like there's a whole bunch of towels in here I'm not sure which ones I'm supposed to use and it might sound like a stupid example but again it's incredibly little effort and it anticipates that need and anyone who has ever been to a good restaurant and not necessarily like a fancy expensive restaurant but just one where it is well Ron it can be a little family joint there's this thoughtfulness that goes into greeting you at the door how you get to the table you know there's a very big difference between the abrupt please wait to be seated and then kind of like a mean host or hostess and the kind of welcoming and a huge amount of thoughtfulness that goes into the presentation on the menu like there's a lot of places that use light gray text on white paper that's tiny and then it's dark in the restaurant and you see people to pull out their phones don't him you see someone pulled their phone in a restaurant like there was a failure of thoughtfulness on the part of the restaurateur but also the noise levels how responsive the the servers are like there's a screen experience where you never feel like you're being pestered and yet anytime you want something there right there lucky now if you're what your waters empty they're there refilling it when you're ready to have the plates taken away they're taken away when you're ready for the bill the bill just magically shows up no those require like you know a $500 tasting menu at a three-star Michelin restaurant so it's a lot of the same things for us so we will produce it and and you know I'm absolutely myself had in the guilty of this I spent decades as a designer for a living of this looks cool when I like step back and look at it but boy that tax is actually super hard to read you know like there's like important explanatory tax that's right underneath it or there's an example recently just from slack so when you create a channel the channel name and this is changing soon but for now anyway it has to be lowercase letters we had a field in the iOS app that capitalized the first letter of your word so we would you would type a lowercase letter we would capitalize it you could finish typing the thing you would hit enter and then we tell you uh-uh no uppercase letter is allowed and that's like it's just such an incredible example of not something that anyone would have prioritized and the creation of this dialog boxing like we've got a requirement we're going to work on this future it's that kind of oversight so a lot of it is just running through the experience yourself and really again putting that effort in to put yourself in the position of someone who doesn't know this stuff doesn't care about it doesn't have the same set of priorities you do they don't work for slack that I'm not interested in whether we're successful or not other than you know they're a customer they would like us to continue to exist what do they want what what experience are they looking for and that's 9 p.m. and they just put the kids down right yeah exactly you know and when they think about that we're thinking about the future work and we got all kinds of amazing visions and we're in this hundred year transformation and we're starting to really understand how to make use of all this technology to work better and come to mean it's a messy process now and meanwhile for them it's like I'm mad at this person because they've got a promotion I didn't and I'm like annoyed with my spouse because they said they were gonna go pick up stuff from the store and they didn't do it just like you know all the things that were going on in their life like I said we're not even in the top thousand of their concern you think about hiring a host mm-hmm right a product host or what what are the what do you look for and I mean in talked earlier about how and no one's ride all over the time it's a tough one you know there's a couple of things that for me are showstoppers and one of them would be the kind of person who is rude to the receptionist or rude to the server in the restaurant rude to the you do garden away in I think is just not gonna have the the ability to put other people first you know that's just kind of like it's three strikes in one action for me hygiene issues right there some people are just strangely dismissive you know they unless someone's important to them and and it's gonna be valuable for them for some reason they're just jerks so we know there's an obvious one the rest of them are a lot more subtle one positive worker is curiosity and an open mind it's an indicator for me of a couple qualities that are positive so the approach eveness I think is one of them intelligence is another but the curiosity is important in its own right like it's just it's a stance towards the world which is like I like to learn I'm you know I have theories I'm excited to test them out and I want to understand how things work and if you have that orientation I think you can much more likely to be successful suppose you think about here you are you've got a great host you've got a great product you're in a bigger company or a little company and you're you're doing well you're actually able to drive change mm-hmm are you leading and this is the question we always get into around the product are you leading ahead of what the customer wants are you responsive to what they want are you creating something that they've never seen before mmm-hmm what's your what's your take on this because I think you know you've got this great vision around communication and I think everyone's starting to see it but I don't think everyone saw yourself what Anderson Horowitz was saying yeah we didn't we definitely I mean like we really thought that as the biggest we could ever get is like how big we got about 18 months ago and that was definitely wrong and now the sights are set much higher I'm gonna take that there are no I'm like literally hundreds of millions of people who will be using slack or something like it within the next decade and for now at least we're number one not knock on this little wooden here thing I'm trying to say this in a way that doesn't appear like it's contradictory so let's see if it's if it's a contradiction but by the way this question is contradiction it's very hard it's like how far do you lead your customers right I mean it's it's definitely it's a column response kind of thing and it's some it requires pain deep attention I think of it a little bit more like performer on stage like a magician or a musician or whatever feeding off the audience reacting to them like having an understanding of their cues but not when someone holds up their lighter and says Freebird instantly stopping the song that you're playing and starting to play Freebird maybe you don't play Freebird all night you know and you're responsible for for their entertainment and you don't just do exactly what they want you did you you're trying to create for their benefit but if you don't pay the attention to them at all you know look if you're trying to do stand-up comedy and you just have no sense of the room you're gonna bomb for sure I think we tend to look for the intent behind what customers are asking rather than the specific implementation because usually the the implementation that they're requesting the feature that they're request here are the change in the product is really driven by what they see today and it's it's reacting to that rather than kind of what the higher goal is and what the higher goal is for any executive any manager is gonna be we want to increase the linemen we want to break down silos we wanna make sure everyone's coordinated on the same page pushing in the same direction and what's interesting is the non-executive non manager the workers inside the organization actually want exactly the same thing when do you think about office space the movie or the TV show the office or like Dilbert or anything any of those tropes of office life and the disenfranchisement that people feel are alienation it's really I don't feel like I understand the context for these decisions nothing makes any sense and not in the loop I don't understand these other groups are doing and they all seem to be working on the same project but it's redundant and that overlap in the kind of like the Venn diagram of what the end users let's say inside the organization wonder what the leaders want is exactly the sweet spot that that slot tries to drive towards it's interesting the way you explain it around you know if you're an artist and you're on stage and how your your jobs really to give them a show mhmmm right and that's they're obviously they're yeah right so I'm the reason I said it was like contradictory is because I'm just saying that you're trying to you know be the host and not you're not the rock star but if I can come up with a better or if you can come up with a better analogy there I'd love to hear it but there is you know the the key point there is paying attention to them and having a read for it and understanding their reactions and be able to you know if you are a good magician it's all about misdirection and where people are paying attention so you don't have a really good sense of what people are thinking about then you're gonna fail I think it's the same thing in software like you really have the last question is if we think about creative right you are designer I think one of the challenges you know I run creative teams we every organization does it differently how do you think about where creative plays in the role of product and engineering I think there's Eliquis so many different ways I can answer this but the one that because the last word you said was engineering that you know that got me thinking was the interplay between product and engineering because you can in poorly function organizations you can be like here's what we want to do and then the response can be that's impossible or that's too expensive or it's too hard or it won't work because of of whatever and even if that's the first response the in a well-functioning product development organization both sides get creative in that okay so that that's too expensive that's going to take too long or that's too complicated or that's not gonna work or it's impossible what about if we did it this way well yeah I guess if we did it this way then we could do this and there's this kind of negotiation and you know and you can think about it in one sense like two parties who are in opposition negotiating to some kind of consensus is in the middle or in the best case that's kind of like Lennon and McCartney or Jagger and Richards or something like that luck there's no actual interplay and we're pushing in this direction we're pushing in this direction and we it's multiplicative like we actually accentuate each other's strengths and drive to whatever the best solution is so that's definitely the idea don't not realize everyday but that's the game well it's typically after that you know the third fourth fifth six in duration that you actually come upon something great and I think if that doesn't exist then you're always going with the first or the second you don't ever actually do anything yeah it's like the turn over what it was but the first version of yesterday that song as the scrambled eggs his legs are broccoli or something like because you try to think of what the lyrics would be that that's good that that version didn't get out yeah yeah well look it's a true pleasure I think we're all watching the growth and we're excited to see this whole vision play out I think it's exciting time so thanks for thanks for all your help yeah great to talk to you all right\n",

11 days gives me 17 days so what that tells me is across this path I've got 17 days of slack again let's look at this bottom path between paths B D F and then finish I've got six days of slack quite simply it's 13 from 19 days the early start from excuse me yep the early start from the early finish and so across this bottom path I've got sick days of slack this tells me that I start my task and I follow along my critical chain I still have six days to play with through this network path through to the end and I've got more days I've got 17 days to play with on that top end it's important to determine where that slack is so you know where you need to put your effort in focusing the team of getting those tasks done and when you can back off your effort appropriately because you don't need to necessarily push them on that path to the end because you've got 17 days to play with the tivity on the node diagramming method is very very useful as I said in helping you determine the risks through the schedule refining your time estimates and most importantly helping you find that slack which as we know time is precious to a project manager for more project management tips and techniques come check us out at projectmanager.com\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: what's up Frank dad what's going on guys my name is Brendan teach if you're new to the channel owner and co-chair prime shake where we get athletes really strong really Jack today we're gonna teach you about slack pulling the deadlift now I know you've heard this probably a thousand times but this is one thing that will instantly improve your deadlift once you get it down however it's probably the hardest thing for us to teach to our athletes this usually takes some months to get it down and simultaneously almost every video I see on this on YouTube or Instagram is completely wrong and and usually the people teaching the Siple or oftentimes the worst at it so we're gonna dissect what the slack ball actually is how it can help your deadlift and how it's very individual everyone's going to do this actually slightly different depending whether or not you're on a deadlift bar a stiff bar certain kinds of plates whether using bumper or competition plates whether you're male female how much objective load it changes the whole game and then later I'm actually even going to take you onto my computer show you feel my clients and how they all do it differently but first let's dissect the slack ball so simply put what the slack ball is is it's a way to get the most optimal force transferring the deadlift and then also simultaneously this parts probably more important they uses some of the weight from the weight you're going to be dead lifting against itself as leverage and that's the biggest thing here that I think a lot of people misunderstand I think a lot of people think slack bowling is basically just getting up on the bar and pulling a little attention out and getting tight now ready to go but that's not the way we teach the slack wall and I would argue that's almost useless you might as well just grip and rip into it and get some extra power and speed instead of starting a little slower so instead the way we teach the slack Bowl is to teach people how to use leverage against the weight itself and what I mean by that is when I go to slack Bowl even here 315 this being a deadlift bar and some bumper blades and when I pull up on this bar I'm going to take a ton of this slab and I'm gonna pull up against it so you see how much the bars bending there even with this lighter weight I'm gonna pull up and then lean back and wedge into position so it's like when I pull up with my body and I come into it I'm almost rocking back to lean some of that weight and we took out of the bar to use it as a counterbalance so I'm actually quite literally picking up maybe about 20 to 30 percent of the load itself and then try to lead back with them okay so that's what you have to think about this is this is basically almost like a deadlift Jack where we're trying to lean and get leverage on the bar itself and use some of this load itself so we grit set ourselves to set the lats and then we're gonna pull up and then leave and so when it's done fast it's really hard to see but let's go from a side view real quick now most people when they pick up the slack bowl they're just gonna kind of pull some of this tension out right and then start and they're gonna lift and get pulled out of position that position there is - over the bar it's poor leverage we want to try to get back behind the bar now of course it's almost impossible to get the scapula and shoulders fully behind the bar but the idea is we're leaning back and trying to use that weight against itself so when I pull the slack out I'm going to take a bunch of this weight with me okay so I'm going to take my shoulder and try to lift it as far away from the bar as possible when I pull up so I'm gonna go up and then lead and I tried to do that as slow as possible but it's really hard obviously if you do this correctly you can't do it slow because the idea is you're leveraging back so I go up with my shoulders and then lean and harass and drive okay and that gives me leverage over the bar now I'm gonna go show you some examples on my computer of how my clients each do this differently and how you can watch your own footage to see if you're doing it correctly so I wanted to show another view here watch how much was even just 315 on the water watch how much Bend I'm gonna get out of this deadlift bar now there's notes to be said for a stiff bar down the bar kind of plates we'll talk about that later but watch here watch how much I'm going to be able to bend this bar so when I go to pull the slack I'm literally gonna pick up on the bar as much as I can to the point where these first plate this first plate almost starts to leave the ground so right here it should almost like you're pulling that whole way up and the only the last two are still kind of seated down so we're gonna pull up a ton so up with the slack and then you lean back and pull again I'm trying to do this slow to give you a visual but that's not really the correct way of doing this once you do this right you have to do it fast because you're going to take it and then lean back a mistake people make is they'll pick up a ton of slack and they'll do this and then they just lose it when they come down if you lose that slack and your shoulders go back down before you lean back in wedge you've just effectively lost every bit of tension you pull it up out of the weight and now you can't use it as a counterbalance so you have to take the slack pull it up and lean back with it and that would be the only way to leverage itself so let's go check out some of my clients and how they all do it okay guys so let's take a look at a few different videos of both myself Kristin and then also my clients and how we all kind of do this slightly different depending whether or not we're using a stiff or a deadlift bar or whether the weight is 600 pounds on the bar 300 pounds or even some of the different styles my clients have come up with with effectively pulling out the slack ball in a different way than I do it so let's start with my footage from this weekend this was a 650 pound deadlift and we're gonna look at the first rep here and how I basically pulled the slack out so there's a few things I want to kind of cover again that you'll be able to see a lot better with a much heavier weight here because I'm not going to deadlift 650 pounds on my off day for you guys so look here before I even grip the bar look how flat this thing is on the ground completely I haven't set my back and I'm going down to basically grab the barbell after it caught my brace up top and the bar is completely flat the first thing I do is I pre slack pull and I basically I'm gonna set my back here into extension boom and then notice how I bent the bar a little bit I basically picked up on some slack in tension and then set my back with that this is what most people call slack pulling this is useless all this did was kind of help me set my back and pull a little tension out of the bar but you might as well grip and rip from this point like this isn't going to help you at all this is just kind of setting up on the bar but where you're going to get a huge benefit from the slack Bowl as if now watch how I'm going to rate my shoulders and hips to basically pull up on some of this weight as much as I can and it's gonna bend the hell out of this bar so you see there how much event let's go back down here's the bottom here's the bent here's the bottom here's how much I'm bending so I have now picked up probably a couple hundred pounds of slack out of the bar and then I'm gonna take my shoulders and rotate and lean back with it and then before I even broke the floor look how much slack is coming out before I even hit that sticking point look how much this bar is bent now compared to way back here when I first started so here's where I start and then I pick up on the slack and wedge boom and that allows me to effectively pull up a smooth deadlift now what this is done for me my start position is one less range of motion because the so much slack is pulled out look at how high my chest is starting I'm a lot more open instead of being bent over and this is gonna allow me to lean back and lean against the weight the whole time which is gonna give me leverage okay so let's watch that in an even different video here we can come over to the video before which I was a lot more effective on so this was my warmup set before and I actually like the slack pole more so I wanted to show you here but let's watch again look how the bars flat I'm gonna pre slack pull boom so this is what most people call slack point but this isn't anything other than me setting my back and getting a little tension out of the bar it doesn't do that much but here now I'm gonna really pull the slack so we're gonna go up on the bar and then lean and the way you can tell if I'm doing this right is look how as I come into this because I'm pulling my shoulders up and back it's gonna cause this bar to actually Bend more and so by doing this it actually just starts picking up on more slacking and actually picking up the weight before I even get into position it's like it's leveraging it up for me and then I have this easy job look how high my chest is there whoops my mouth stop for a second look how open my chest is and how high it is by just getting into a better position had I started this lift from down here where I just basically pre slack pull look how close off my chest is I'm now effectively starting from a more advantageous position and also effectively using some of the weight against this but this is with the deadlift bar and with 600 plus pounds so let's take a look at a stiff bar which is going to be a little bit different so this is old footage from back when I was training on an Ohio power bar and this was the best video I could find where a demo day now what you're going to notice is there's less slack pull but it does not change the importance of this whether it's a stiff bar or whether you're a female you know only lifting 300 pounds instead of 600 or whatever it may be you always want to pull slack the same way just as hard however the only difference is it's gonna look a little less dramatic but nonetheless if your slack pulling with 300 pounds and you're pulling out you know maybe say 50 pounds of slack to use against the weight itself that's still going to be the same percentage of help than if I pull out you know a couple hundred pounds against the 650 I'm using so the idea is you're taking some of the load and lifting it up and leaning back with it to basically wedge up like a deadlift jacks so let's watch here on the stiff bar let's go down into position watch I'm gonna do everything the same I'm rounded over its first gripping the bar bars flat then I'm gonna pre tension with some slack so I just kind of tension my back into it boom set the back and then watch how little slack I'm gonna get here once I've actually picked it up so you see here at my full lift of slack pole even though this is about 600 pounds just under this bar is barely bending because it is stiffer it is an Ohio power bar it's much different than a deadlift bar so you're not gonna bend as much slack up but it works none the same so here's my start position so this is reverse here's a bar completely flat here's me pulling up on slack and then I'm gonna do the same thing wedge and notice here same thing although I'm starting a little lower than on the deadlift bar bars bent very well and my chest is up and now I'm leaning back and this gives me leverage over it this is how I get so vertical even though I'm built like horribly for being in a vertical position for this so let's close this video out and now let's look at a female so let's take a look at Kristin here or actually no let's look at this video first sorry I want to show you when I do this incorrectly so here's a common mistake people make with this so let's fast forward what do you notice here when I grip this bar and setup one I don't actually set my back very well I'm kind of round it and from that it  up my slack and notice how the bar is rotating into me so watch how these plates are rotating and moving around a lot so watch out the plate literally rolls into me and I end up with very little slack pulled out even though this is 700 pounds so this is over a hundred pounds heavier this is 7/16 and yet I have almost less slack pulled out than the last video with less objective weight which would cause the weight the bar to bend less but this one I did a horrible job of slack pulling and watch the position I end up in backs rounded chest is closed off shoulders are leave forward and this causes grinder sticking point where my nose literally starts bleeding we can play this and you guys can watch my nose leak out of here so this is why this set went so bad is because I did not get into a good position so let's watch a few of these in fast motion too because I want to actually show you that if we go back here again to reiterate that I have to show this in slow motion watch how quickly I do this whole setup with the slack board everything so I'm going to go down to the bar I'm gonna grab it set slack bolt go it's so fast but when we slow it down you can see how much is going on there before I've even you know initiate the rep so when you do this in real time you got to do it fast but you're gonna have to practice slow at first but this is what gives me that leverage against the weight okay so it's very quick when we do this and you can do it very wrong like I just did in the last video now if we go look at a female performing this she's gonna obviously have less objective load on the bar well at least in most cases unless it's like Amanda Lawrence or someone but in most cases we're gonna see less objective load if the trainees weaker or female or whatever and so watch here how the same tactics apply Kristin grips the bar slack pulls and the wedges but look at her start position even on a deadlift bar here the bar is bent nowhere near as much as mine cuz this is only about 315 325 pounds somewhere around there and so she's not gonna pull as much but again it doesn't matter it's just as important for her to pull slack so here's her flat bar and this is her lifting and watch how she's gonna rotate and wedge boom and this allows her to use that weight as a counterbalance the same thing there and then you can even actually come over here to view my clients when we move this out of the way let's take a look at a few my clients and how they kind of slack pull differently so first to start I have my client here to bolt he's a 74 kilo lifter he's also coach himself so he's actually really great at technique because he teaches this stuff for a living Thibault has kind of learned to slack bolt differently than most people he is a sumo puller and this is on a stiff bar so this is an OPD stainless steel I believe or it could even be in a lipo bar not sure but it's basically the stiffest bar you can get on with competition plates which means this bar is going to bend very little it shouldn't be very little slack pull the plates matter because the more the plates are wide like traditional metal plates you see in gyms they're going to be stacked out to the side more which would cause more bends because there's more weight displacement out to the ends of the collars so the less they are the more you use competition style equipment the less slack you're usually going to get out of a bar and especially when you're using a stiff bar but here to bolt starts with a high hip position and then pull slack as he comes down so notice here is he's starting the lift right before he starts look how much even the stainless steel OPP has already bent compared to when he starts here so he comes into it boom big wedge here very little slack pull so he pulls the slack out on the way down only so he starts with this high hip position where he comes down to the bar grips it and then slack pulls and wedges everything up again in fast motion it looks really quick but there's a lot of subtlety and complexity here now let me show you someone doing it incorrectly so this is my client Jake and Jake it's basically Gaines like I think a hunch over 120 pounds or something on his total since we started together a few months ago and um because of this and because of the corona buyers shut down what's caused him to change the equipment he was using he kind of along the way actually lost his ability to slack while he was getting it down really well in the beginning and then kind of he got so strong that it was hard for him to continue practicing it because as you get stronger you need a slack pull harder so let me show you a mistake he was making the other week so I'm just gonna play this one in regular motion he can watch it so he goes down he tries to pull slack and basically ends up just ripping into it and he ends in these really poor positions so look here before we even look at the slack look how stiff his knees are in a conventional this is no good your knees should not be locking by the time you're clearing your knees they shouldn't walk until the hips do so here he has a ton of demand on his hips and back but almost nothing coming from the quads because then these are almost effectively locked his chest is something in and it's down you can't see a broad chest knees are not bent enough which means his quads aren't driving this is a poor position if we come back here look at the start position bars flat and watch when he goes up he barely gets any slack and then he ends up ripping into it look at her start position as he comes down with the hips look how the bars barely bent and then boom he gets hit with the slack and he ends up in this very bent over position and he tries to fight through now because the weight is light he's able to clear these no problem but if this was a max Bowl he's missing just a few inches off the floor so let's go look at his updated video and how he's effectively fixed this problem within a week and it still needs some work but this is a lot better and he's getting it down now with that B weight so first thing first look at the bar being flat and watch as we go on how much slack he's going to pull up and out of it so look at the start position here look how much more bent this barbell is compared to the other one in his start position so let's compare these side-by-side let's take a look here fast forward to that first part look at how little this bars bet once you started compared to this one see how much this one's bowed now let's come over here and watch how when he presses now look at his knees look how they're not as locked his hips are aren't as high knees are more bat chess is more broad let's come back to this one watch how he starts boom look at the difference in his chest position his knee position so right down here look how stiff his legs are how collapse his chest is high in the hips and then even as he's clearing you'll really see it right here knees are almost completely locked at this point we come over to this one knees are a lot more bench chest is a lot more broad and look this is more weight this is four plates and some change this one here's three plates and some change so this one's actually a heavier deadlift that he's locking out much easier because he's getting the slack pulled down here and he's really practicing every we worked on the last week and it's only gonna get better so you see how smooth that rep look compared to this one here let's go back to this first one look look how jerky and and kind of unstable that looks and that's why he tips you can actually see him tip off the floor in slow motion watch how he tips you see that and he has to then re clear this was him performing the slack pull wrong and these are little things you could miss if you don't look at your training footage gonna slow it down so I just kind of want to take you guys through a whole breakdown of the entire slack pole this is a really long video but it's very important that I'm thorough with this because it's so different on everyone and this is something that everyone gets wrong I see all the practitioners out there teaching this all the different coaches and stuff almost none of them truly understand it to be frank and I see everyone teaching it wrong so I hope you enjoyed the video give it a thumbs up and give it a comment if you really liked the video I'm gonna have a lot more in-depth tutorials coming out so I'm rebranding everything on the channel we're gonna be doing a ton of informative content moving forward so I'm excited for that give it a thumbs up give it a comment guys I'll see you in the next one\n",

            "proposals that I personally had written, ciz I had a whole bunch of **** terrible,\n",
            "terrible ideas and this was the one that had the broader consensus among the team\n",
            "as being something that would be valuable. What's interesting at the time though,\n",
            "so we had $5 million left in the bank. None of our investors\n",
            "wanted their money back. They want us to just go\n",
            "try something else and Jason Horowitz is one of our investors,\n",
            "so we went down and did the partner meeting and\n",
            "kind of presented what our big idea was. And at that time, this is before we\n",
            "actually started development of Slack. But when we had this proto version,\n",
            "we said that one day, this could be like a hundred million\n",
            "dollar a year revenue business. It could be valued at a billion dollars\n",
            "on that basis and we thought that, that was like a decade out and\n",
            "that would be the culmination. That would be We have 100% of the ten and we went past that in year two,\n",

            "there's a reality under the metric that's not exactly the metric itself. And so\n",
            "if you focus too much on the metrics, then you start to get into things like,\n",
            "there's these ways to game the metrics. And we can make the metrics go up, but actually we're doing some things that\n",
            "are going to hurt us long-term, and those things are going to\n",
            "outweigh the short-term benefits. So I would really make sure\n",
            "to be careful about that. I'd say, personally, I think the ideal\n",
            "is to be somewhere in the middle, and I'd say you want to be very close to\n",
            "taking the metrics extremely seriously. Not too seriously, but I think most companies bias toward not\n",
            "being serious enough about their metrics. If you're in the right, if you're middle\n",
            "in the right spot then you're learning, you're making good decisions,\n",
            "and you're informed. But you're still aware that there\n",
            "is a product underneath, and there is a strategy and there's more\n",
            "to the world than just these metrics. I see a lot of times companies\n",
            "will oscillate between these, like they'll say,\n",
            "they'll get really focused on metrics and then that causes them to do some\n",
            "things that they think are bad. And they're like these\n",
            "metrics are terrible, and we're going to throw away our metrics,\n",
            "not focus on them at all. And then you get into this world where you\n",
            "don't actually know what you're doing, and there's no accountability. And so oscillation is not very productive, you want to just make sure you find\n",
            "the right point and try to stick there. So finally, I want to just talk about some\n",
            "of these psychological aspects that come with metrics. I think one of the big things that\n",
            "come when you start measuring things, is you just get closer to\n",
            "being in touch with reality. And that can be painful, because sometimes the metrics are going to\n",
            "be worse than you thought they were. So sometimes they can be better than\n",
            "you thought, and that's great, and everyone feels great. But a lot of times if you weren't\n",
            "measuring something chances are you weren't even aware of it, it was\n",
            "hard for you to make it good, and so it won't be good. And so\n",
            "that means that as you set up metrics, there's going to be some pain,\n",
            "and that can cause problems for companies, I even think at the leadership\n",
            "level, this can get even worse. Actually, I think the majority of leaders\n",
            "out there in the world rely on some amount of delusion they're\n",
            "creating among their followers. To get them excited, to have them working\n",
            "on this project in the first place, and metrics can get in the way of that. And so people get into this, then you get\n",
            "into this question of like, okay, well, what should you do as a leader? And this is where I come out,\n",
            "after thinking about this for a long time. I think you want to be learning from the\n",
            "past, so you want everyone fully aware of what has happened, what has worked,\n",
            "what has not worked. You want to be totally in touch with\n",
            "the reality of where you are today. So if things are good,\n",
            "you should know they're good. If things are not good, you should know\n",
            "they're not good, you should know exactly where there are problems, and\n",
            "where there are not problems. But then, those things are not in tension\n",
            "with being optimistic about the future, you should be optimistic about the future. Because there's so much potential, and the reason you're doing a startup\n",
            "is because of this potential. And if you don't feel\n",
            "confident that the path you're on is able to get you to a place\n",
            "that you feel optimistic about, then that's a good sign that you\n",
            "might want to change the path. And you should do something about that,\n",
            "because it's totally in your control. So there's not really a tension\n",
            "between acknowledging that things are not in a great spot, and having people\n",
            "not be optimistic about the future. So as long as you just make sure that\n",
            "the reality is that, and I don't think you should make people optimistic about the\n",
            "future in a way that you don't believe. I think you should do the things you need\n",
            "to do, to get yourself to be confident, and optimistic about the future. And then it's easy to get\n",
            "people to follow through that. So that's all I have, and\n",
            "happy to take questions. >> [INAUDIBLE] the question\n",
            "with the IT's desk >> [LAUGH] >> Thank you very much. >> [APPLAUSE]\n",
            ">> All right, see you on Thursday.\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: all right so you all are here for the thriving with your team and slack session so it's nice to see all of you my name is rachel leigh i'm on the accounts team here at slack i've been here for about nine or so months prior to being here I was at box for a few years I am really excited about companies that are building products that transform the way that we work that's really exciting for me the other reason I'm excited for this session in particular is because I personally am just a sucker for productivity tips I love it hacks tips all of it it's my jam so I hope that's why all of you are here as well so before we get started I'd love to just understand a little bit about who we have here in the room how many of you all have been using slack for just under a month raise of hands okay we've got a few folks what about three to six months little few more hands what about nine months and beyond all right we got a lot of hands here so certainly have a mix of folks in the room final question before we jump in how many of you all are admins or owners or primary owners of your team okay it's a majority of folks and I guess it's safe to say the rest of you all our end users I am on our slack team as well so what you can expect today is really just a bunch of tips and tricks to help you get more out of slack so a lot of you may already be experts you may know a lot of this we're going to do a bit of periodic polling and checking to kind of feel the room and see how this is going we would love your feedback on how we can make this better in the future all right so you've been hearing this all throughout the day April shared it and Allie referred to it as well but this is because it's really really important to us at slack it ties in to every single thing that we do and also ties in to our conversation today our mission is to make people's working lives simpler more pleasant and more productive so if we can help you do that as you communicate with your team as you get your job done we really want to make that impact and it also ties into the way that this conversation will continue today the first part of our conversation is about how you can work in suc how you can get more out of slack as you are using it for yourself that's the productivity aspect secondly slack is no fun if you use it by yourself I hope none of you are using slack by yourself that's not going to be very fun and so how you can actually use it with your team and get the most out of it and then thirdly and related to our panel that we just had how you can foster your team culture in slack how you can bring the best aspects of your culture and grow that within slack and how slack can actually help you do that so the first part is working in slack and really will jump in and get your thoughts and feedback hopefully some of these tips and tricks will be new stuff that you didn't actually know coming in here so we've heard a lot about this slack really helps increase the transparency you can see the conversations that are not only happening within your team in your sphere within your organization but you can see that across the entire business and that's really cool but there's a lot of information that's available now at your fingertips so how can you not be distracted how can you really focus on what you care about and what's important to you we have a few tips to help with that the first one is starring conversations every single channel private channel direct message can be start which means that it's pinned to the top left hand corner of your sock interface it's going to stay there and it's really easy to jump back and forth to those conversations you're going to want to star conversations that you participate in literally every day so maybe DMS with your boss DMS with your colleagues your project channels your team channels those are great ones to start right there in the top left the second one is highlight words and this is really really powerful it's a way for you to customize for every single end user you're proactive notifications so what you care about and slack will proactively notify you anytime one of those highlight words are triggered right so this could be your project that you're working on your own name so for me Rachel is one of my highlight words so even if so one forgets to @mention me anytime they say Rachel I'm going to be notified right I mentioned I work with clients all day so anytime one of my customer names are mentioned let's say someone writes in with an urgent customer support ticket even if no one stops to think about hey Rachel will probably want to know about this anytime they mention that client name I'm going to be notified in our Zendesk channel for example some fun use cases for this is people will type it put in the phrase sign up so anytime there's a new sign up for a new perk like a massage or yoga classes you'll be the first to know if anyone says food trucks we're going to go for food trucks you're right there to sign up and head out the door with them how many of you all are already using highlight words show of hands okay hopefully was new for the rest of you before I move on actually one of the best practices that I learned from a customer is they were an evangelist that brought slack into their team and they were responsible for answering the queuing the questions that a lot of the folks on their team had so they actually put slack as one of their highlight words because they realize that whenever someone's mentioning slack it's because they have a question and they're saying hey do you know how to do this in slack or I tried this in sauk and it didn't work and so that highlight word actually triggered their notification they jumped in and we're ready to help next at mention panels this is sits at the top right hand corner of slack and it basically collects all of the action items so any time you were at mention it's going to save that in your at mention panel for you this is the first thing that I check when I've been away from slack maybe I was in a meeting or two meetings and I've been away from slack I haven't checked it probably what I'm going to do right after this is go and check my @mention panel so I can see who asked me to look at something where we view something that's a great place to prioritize when you come back to slack for the first time after being away yep the question was do you also get notification on highlight words that you are not part of the answer is no so you want to be a member of those channels and in just a bit we're going to talk about how you can control be a part of a lot of channels but kind of turn down the volume on that great question what we're looking at here is the ability to customize notifications on a per channel basis this is incredible we don't get to do this with email right you get an email that says you got a new follower on Twitter or someone endorsed you on LinkedIn it's really great but I don't need that to light my phone up right just as when I get an urgent email that says hey I need you to do this and it's run my boss that email comes to me and notifies me in the same exact manner in slack you can actually customize those notifications on the channels that you care about most so if you are in an active project and you're up against a deadline you can dial up those notifications hit me with a desktop notification if I don't respond to that send me a mobile push notification if I don't respond to that then and only then send me an email so I don't lose track of anything but if this is a fun channel like the maybe Food & Drink channel where people share new restaurant recommendations I don't need to know about that all the time so I'm going to crank down the notifications on that one how many of you folks are already doing this and customizing your notification preferences all right that's a good handful of folks so this is kind of going back to the question mentioned earlier that's great how can I now I know how to focus my attention on what I care about but there's a lot of other channels that I care about but I don't need to be notified proactively all the time so we have some tips on that end as well conversations in slack just like in real life are fluid they happen they end they move on we go on to the next thing and it's a really fluid conversation right and so in slack we make it really easy for you to join the channels that are important to you but also leaf right so a good example is within our slack team we have tons of help channels help IT help benefits finance etc you go in there you have a quad you ask your benefits related question you get a great answer and then you can leave that channel and you no longer have to have that sitting on your left-hand side but the next time you have a benefits question it's very easy for you to jump back in there and ask the question I will admit the first time I created a channel and I saw someone leave because you can see all that every time someone joins in leaves a channel you can see it it's all tracked it was a little bit sad I was like does my channel not matter to you but it actually saves all of us a lot of productivity if we're just in the ones that matter to us the most but sometimes you don't want to take it quite as far as to leave the channel completely you still care about it but you just don't want it to turn bold every single time someone's posting a new question or has something new to share in that channel so if you don't want to go so far as to leave the channel or you don't want to hurt someone's feelings you can mute the channel and that's just by doing /mute and so this is what I do for channels where I want to get those proactive notifications based on my highlight words but I don't want it to turn bold for me I only want to check it when I'm being triggered right so our Zendesk channel is a great example all of the tickets that come in from our customers pipe into our Zendesk channel it's one of the apps that we have installed on our team and so it's great because any time one of my customers again going back to that example writes in I'm going to get that notification but I don't need to turn it to have it turn bold every single time so that's one that I have muted we have a sales events channel so every time someone purchases slack that gets recorded but I don't need to know about that all the time I can check that on my own time over the weekend after work etc so that's a muted channel our kyvan channels this is really really great when for example you are working on a project and it's a really active conversation for example when we were planning for this event today we had a channel where all of us across the company were working together planning etc but once the event ends we do a post-mortem we gather feedback we have stats we're going to go ahead and archive that channel because it's not an active conversation that we want to have people continue to be a part of archiving the channel means that all the contents in that channel will be archived searchable reference later for the next event that we put on but it's not going to be an open conversation that new people on your team can join important distinction is if the channel is no longer relevant for just you you want to leave the channel like we talked about earlier if it impacts everyone who's participating in that channel you're going to want to archive we had someone on our team who on their first day at SLAC where it's in one of our fun channels and I'm not going to look at it because I don't want to call him out he's in the room but he accidentally he was in a fun challenge it's like oh this is great but I want to focus on my work so I'm gonna archive the channel and everyone got a notification and it was not a fun way to start a talk so now he knows and you all now know so that you don't have to make that same mistake so this next one was actually referenced earlier downstairs and some of you may already know about this but for the rest of us do not disturb is a really really great feature when you want to be heads down on focused sometimes we just need an hour to to step away from slack really work on a project or a deliverable that we're working on do not disturb as mentioned is one step to kind of get you in that direction so what you can do is actually click on that bell icon next to your team name and choose from one of our pre designated times and what this does is lets you actually snooze your notifications but more importantly it notifies everyone on the team with an indicator that you are currently in do not disturb mode you're being really focused so when they send you a message they're going to get a slack bot message that says hey Rachel is currently and do not disturb mode she's going to get this when she's back back online if something is urgent and they want to push through that they can also push through your do not disturb as well so you have that flexibility but this is really helpful to kind of be heads down and focus when you need to I'm curious how many folks are already using do not disturb or already knew about this before just now okay all right so I got a good one for all of our inbox zero fans in the room raise your hand if you're an inbox zero fan I am yeah so this feature is often unknown because it's kind of tucked away if you go to your preferences and advanced options under channel list we have a way for you to hide all channels with no unread activity unless they are starred so just to kind of go back here if you keep your eye to that right-hand sidebar you'll see that clean up really nicely it basically gets rid of anything that has unread activity and just gives you a lot of peace of mind for inbox zero fans this is huge and it's kind of a game for me to be like how can I read through all of my channels really quickly as I said conversations are fluid messages come in but you can't always take action on them right away maybe you're on your way to the office or you're in a meeting or on a call so we have a few tips on how you can come back to that message later on in time the first one is starring so I know we talked about stars earlier not to be confused with that any message in slack itself can actually be starred so this is a great way for you to pick out messages that are good reference items things you want to jump back to later so for example Carl made this ask for this update on the home page makeover I'm going to star that and then it's going to keep that on my Start items which sits right next to your add mention panel so this is a really nice way for you to kind of curate your list maybe think of it as bookmarks on your browser the really cool thing that I actually didn't know until very recently is that you can search just within your Start items so if you know like hey I know that the new comp plan was something that I starred I want to jump back to that really quickly in your search bar and we'll go to that in a bit you can actually say has star and it'll just search among your starred items which is really knit neat this one is one of my favorite features in slack which is the remind feature and you can actually make slack bot work for you so how do you do this all you need to do is do a slash remind and that's going to let know that you want to set a reminder and it's just really kind of plain syntax language remind me to share the updated results in 30 minutes slack bot is going to send you a confirmation message and then in 30 minutes he's going to ping you slack bot is actually non gender-specific so slack bot will ping you in 30 minutes to say hey share the updated results you can even do slash remind list and get a list of all the reminders that you set so remind me to drink water at 3 p.m. every day cool thing is you can also set reminders for other people on your team so if you're in a meeting and you want to say hey Jessica this action item is for you I'm just going to put send that to you in slack bot do slash remind at Jessica and the reminder the cool thing is when she completes that task or that action that confirmation comes to you as well which is really cool how many of you knew that already and are using that okay you got a good one alright so this is my other favorite feature is the ability to mark messages as unread and slack I'm still waiting for Apple to add this iMessage this is basically a way for you to mark any message in slack as unread so that you actually have that red badge notification that says hey you need to come back to this message so stars again are good for bookmarking but this is more for actually reminding you with a actual trigger to say come back to this at a later point in time any message can be can be marked as unread basically you just hover to the right there on the ellipses and then you'll see mark on red as an option so it's kind of more of that active reminder to jump back to a message when you're ready to take action now when you are ready to come back to a message the easiest way to do this is using our quick switcher this is by far my favorite or cut in slack and that's command K or Windows K if you're on a Windows machine once you click command K you get this pop-up which is our quick switcher and it's actually algorithmically made smart so that it surfaces to the very top the conversations that you are in the most so for example I talk in marketing team channel the most so you'll see even though it's not alphabetically-ordered correctly it's going to push that to the top because that's the one that I communicate in most often what you'll also notice about this pop-up is the channel naming convention that we have going on here this is our recommendation for any channel that you're naming put all of the related ones together with the first prefix same prefix so marketing - team marketing - events njet cetera the reason for this it really helps with channel discovery so if I'm not on the marketing team and I have a question about this event I might initially say oh yeah that should go in the marketing channel where 100 people communicate well once I start typing in marketing I'll see the marketing - events channel and say actually this is probably better for the 50 people that are in this channel because they actually care about marketing events more specifically and I'll get a quicker answer that way how many of you folks are already kind of coming up with this naming convention cool so the final thing before we move into how to actually use lock with your team is search and search is really really important because the more you communicate in slack the more slack becomes that archive for your team that brain right so the more information you have in there and the more you need to actually be able to search that really quickly this is also really helpful when new members join your team because they have access to this knowledge base of every conversation that was had before they joined whereas in a typical organization where you're not using slack you get an empty inbox and that's your day one and that's where you begin so in slack modifiers help you immensely because it allows you to filter your search results based on what it is that you do know so if you don't know how to get to the modifiers or if you don't memorize this screenshot which is okay you just need to put in a plus into your search bar in slack it's going to give you the same drop-down and you can use any one of these filters alone or you can combine them to make a really really refine search result so let's try one together here I'm going to look in my team for the word design I get nothing close to 9,000 messages and over 4,500 files I am NOT going to sit there and parse through all of these messages and files so the first thing I'm going to do is remove all of the messages from integrations and BOTS because I know for a fact that this was shared by a human and I want to look for it the next thing is I know that I was shared in the marketing team this was a marketing asset so it was likely shared in there so I'm going to use the in-channel modifier and sure enough I get down to 55 messages and just four files and the one that I'm looking for from CC is sitting right at the top so that is the way that you want to use search and I remember the first time that I started using modifiers it changed my world because it made it much more easier to actually get to the information that I was looking for as I mentioned earlier you can also put in your modifier has : stars so you want to just search within the start items that you've curated so some of you already have your entire team ons like how many of that how many of you guys okay a good number of you the rest of you guys maybe are starting out and the thing that's similar across all of our teams is that we're always going to have new people joining our team joining your company that have to be introduced to slack so hopefully some of these tips will help you along those friends the first one is if you haven't started using a stock with your entire company or maybe you are not yet at the point where you want to synchronize your Active Directory this is something that can potentially help with your launch day and really help you streamline your overall onboarding process on our paid plans standard and plus we have what we call slack user groups and you can think of user groups very similar to distribution lists it's a group of people that need usually have to have the same access to information so your engineering user group your design user group maybe your Android team your accounts team and you're in a larger Channel and you want to call them out specifically you can use user groups to do that the second benefit of user groups is the ability to actually synchronize those or excuse me set default channels for those users oops so if I'm an engineer on my first day I don't get added to slack and just have my general and my random Channel I get access to the five engineering specific channels that I need to have access to on a continuous basis going back to Active Directory you can actually synchronize your ad groups and map those to the slack user groups that you have which is really great I see some heads nodding which is cool the benefit of synchronizing with your ad is twofold for the end user it's one less username and password that you need to remember for the admin it really secures your provisioning and de-provisioning process so it creates much less headache and as you're thinking about creating your space and bringing on the rest of your team we have a few tips on how to actually set up your space so that when new members join your team it's very clear to them how they're expected to communicate in your team and also they have some information there that's already prepared to help them so what am I talking about usually we recommend having your general channel your general channel I don't know if everyone knew this already but it's the one channel that everyone is mandatorily required to be a part of you can't leave that one so it's great to transform that into your announcements channel where you want to post things that are really important for everyone on your team to read and so in that channel maybe having a post like this that welcomes them into slack for the first time and has a post like the gentleman mentioned about key things that you want your team to know about slack so this might be those channel naming guidelines key kind of etiquette and slack one thing that I heard from a customer was we came up with our like slack etiquette guidelines right so with any tool you want to kind of set some ground rules one of them that I thought was really interesting it was actually referenced earlier is not just saying direct messaging someone is saying hi are you there and waiting for them to come back because now you've grabbed my attention but I don't have anything to respond to so instead of doing that saying hi this is the question that I have and leave that for them and send that all to them in one message so that they can see the context of what your ask is and respond to you much more efficiently channel naming guidelines also help avoid channel duplication if fifteen people on your marketing team joined they're like oh there's no marketing channel I'm going to create one now you have 15 different marketing channels that you have to clean up and that's not fun and then for the folks that already have your entire team on slack we recommend creating a help slack channel and that's really useful because everyone can go there to ask their slot questions and then your power users your cells will be there ready to answer their questions how many of you already have a Help slack channel cool all right so you've got your team on slack they're like all right you've convinced me I'm going to try this thing out asking people to asking people to change the way that they work it's not easy they've been using the same methods for communicating with their teams for decades and you're asking them to completely transform that change is hard none of us like it so we have a few recommendations on how to make that a little bit easier we've had some people in the audience already share on how they did that some things that we saw work really well is to make it a little bit more fun so what you see here in the middle is our slack day poster just like you wouldn't see a movie hit theaters without months and months and months of trailers precluding that proceeding going up to that you don't want to just say hey starting from today you all are using slack you kind of want to get the word out there get them excited help them understand what to expect when they're going to start using sock and you can go in and kind of prepare it and that way there's information that's waiting for them when they jump in so some actual live customer examples of this BuzzFeed is one of our customers and they actually created for them it was really important that everyone had the mobile app installed very much like you shared that's a really big part of the slack experience because you can actually start communicating with your team without having to directly be at your desk and so for them because that was so important they decided to on their slack day go around and check everyone's phones if you had the slack app installed they actually made custom slack cocktails called the channel back message if you had it on your phone then you got a drink which is pretty cool Marketo is another example they recently launched slack and they created a user checklist and it was the 10 most important things that you need to do in slack and every new user got this it was upload your profile photo maybe add a few more bits of information to your custom profile fields I'm cher which office you're part of things like that and once you finish that checklist you could go into the help select channel and say hey I'm done I did this and that was usually their first message that they posted in a public Channel and the first 50 people actually got a pair of slacks so that was really cool and it actually got them in the habit of using slack just like Microsoft the on the first versions of Windows they actually installed solitaire and freecell on there not because they wanted people to play games and card games at work it was because they wanted to get people comfortable with using the mouse and moving around on the screen and so that's why they put that there and so it's a similar kind of concept where you want to get people interested and kind of in the habit of starting to use slack some other examples are customers who actually got their CEO to do and asked me anything in am a in a slack channel and that got people communicating out in the open they could see oh wow this person asks the question that I actually had the same question and because they asked that in the public channel I get to see the answer and that light bulb moment gets to go off so let's move on to how to actually this is really for the folks in the room that are really starting at the beginning wanting to get your team onto slack as we mentioned change can be difficult and we're asking people to change the way that they work you might be sitting in your seat and thinking this is going to be really hard we have a lot of people who love email who love outlook at my company I can't imagine how we're actually going to get them all on board you all have heard some great tips already but when you're starting off we recommend that you start small don't feel like you have to get every single person on your company on slack tomorrow we suggest actually starting with a small this is really great because you can actually test this out with a small group of people at your company see if this is going to work what works well what doesn't work well and then extrapolate that to the rest of your company or your organization the other nice part is you know starting small get the feedback and being able to share that with the rest of the team when the rest of your team joins slack there's already some content there where they can get the context of oh this is how we're going to use slack this is how we communicate on this tool one of the tips that we actually heard and learn from a customer is a concept of using slack on a specific day of the week so for them it was slack Fridays and their overall mission and their goal was to move all of their internal communication from email to slack but like some of you in the room may be feeling that felt overwhelming and it felt like they weren't going to be able to do that on day one so they chose Friday's on Fridays they were like you guys instead of email let's try communicating on slack slowly but surely everyone started realizing hey this is actually a much easier way for us to communicate with each other we're going to just move over completely and it was kind of that small network effect but it doesn't have to all happen on one day overnight you can also try running short term projects on slack we've seen this work really well where it's like a two to three week project you say hey this is a really cool opportunity for us to actually put slack to the test use the free plan anyone can create it and use it for however long you like with however many people and you can actually use slack to create channels for your project maybe pin important documents like design specs and notes and actually share those within the channel how many of you all are doing stand-up meetings or your status update meeting is in slack okay so we're starting to see this actually on many many projects and not just developer teams you might have seen people say slack helped me reduce meetings and the reason is because a lot of those information sharing and gathering meetings that we all have every single week recurring can actually be moved to slack and you don't have to step away from your desk you don't have to dial in and spend five minute setting up a conference call you can actually just do that in slack so the way to do that is one of the ways is actually to use that remind feature that I talked about earlier so you can say slash remind this channel so this is let's just say the account steam channel remind account steam to post their update every day at 10 a.m. every weekday at 10 a.m. and slack bot will come in here and just ping the channel and say hey share the three things that you're working on today and any blockers that you may have this is really great for everyone because what people don't really confess is that when you're doing those in person you're not really listening to what your team members are sharing right because you're thinking what did I work on yesterday what can I share so this is really nice everyone gets to think about it thoughtfully and actually document that and it's nice to reference later on when you need to someone shared this earlier about using the emojis but we actually use this at slack a lot and this is actually really helpful for cross-functional collaboration so as you can see on here Todd is actually asking Mari to review a security questionnaire and he's communicating the urgency of the status with that red emoji for us a white emoji is just a question or feedback it's not urgent blue is I like an answer within a few days but it's not super super urgent right now Mari will comment back and communicate that she's looking at it with the eyeball emoji and that's just one last message that needs to get posted to that entire channel for everyone to check so the eyeballs communicate I'm looking at this and then once the issue is resolved or the security question area is done and reviewed she'll put a white checkmark there so this is a really great way to kind of make it easier for different parts of your organization to communicate with each other in a really efficient way and what's nice about this is you don't necessarily have to be in the same office working together face-to-face you can still get your jobs done really really easily all right so now let's fast-forward you've got your entire team on board into slack how can you actually help them see slack as a place where important information is being communicated it it's not just another tool to check we recommend posting company-wide announcements updates from leadership a really cool example that I actually heard from a customer they were thinking about how do I make people come back to slack on day two how do I make slack sticky a place to return one idea like the gentleman shared is to post cookie updates another idea is this company in particular created a leadership channel and they put captain they just designated someone every single week to post a question about leadership essentially to start a discussion around a topic that they cared about and it was really cool because they started to see people come there as a place to have discussions and conversations with their colleagues about something that they all cared about and then once the week was over the person passed the question on or the baton on to someone else within the company where they could ask the questions and start up the discussion that way in this example we're announcing new announcements promotions things like that you'll see people had a lot of fun with the emoji reactions congratulating them imagine all of this all these congratulations good job yeah happy for you all of that coming in as an individual email that would be nuts and so instead of doing that or posting that into stock individually you can actually just use reactions to show your support for your colleagues all right I'm going to kind of skip through this a little bit for the sake of time but generally we recommend communicating as much as possible in the channels openly this goes back to the theme of transparency that has already been brought up today but really being able to share your information and and your knowledge with the rest of your team of course confidential conversations do need to happen at slack we absolutely use slack for everything every single private sensitive conversation it happens on slack I get zero emails absolutely zero and so hiring discussions compensation conversations all that will happen in private channels alright so the Bob converse a ssin is happening downstairs but as a lot of you have mentioned the integrations are really really helpful it's kind of the next level where you see slack bringing the tools that you're using at work together in one place so slack comm slash apps this is our app directory April mentioned it earlier as well this is where you can go to find integration and apps with a lot of the tools that you're already using Zendesk Twitter github robot envoy stripe etc we recommend you know maybe even during a pilot going ahead and installing the apps that your team already uses so that when your team joins for the first time they can actually see all those integrations so some of my favorite ones for example Zendesk I already mentioned this but anytime one of my customer writes in I know about it anyone in your company can see the tweets that are going out about maybe a new feature that your company is released or a new update that you've released you don't have to be in the marketing team to get that update if you go to slack comm slash apps you'll also see these categories on the left-hand side this is a really great way to discover new apps as well so if you're looking for something related to guests check-in so when people check in and are trying to meet with you you can actually get that update through a tool called Envoy for example we have nice categories for you to kind of sort and find the apps that you're looking for more easily there are now over 300 apps so categories and stuff like this helps a lot but every single team and company is a little bit different and your needs may be different so for that we actually have bot kits and api's to help you customize your slack even further so what you see here is a slack bot it's actually a custom slash command and we actually have this within our own flock team you may be familiar with the use case where someone says hey I have a buddy at Global gadgets and he wants to use lock who should I put him in touch with who's working with global gadgets at our what we did is cut this up on the back end with our crm tool so anyone in the company can do slash accounts type in the name of the company and you'll actually get a slack bot private message that lets you know who within your organization is working with them and if you actually want to see this live at our helpdesk afterwards you can go in and actually see this installed on some of our demo teams when you see down here is actually an example of something that our business operations team built this is a daily update that updates every four hours so it's not very updates every four hours and reports back on the key performance indicators that we have set for ourselves as goals and so typically this would come into a data warehouse where your data team might see it but the rest of your company wouldn't see that you might get that in a weekly or monthly company update but you don't get a daily pulse of how you're progressing this integration or this bot is really helpful for that all right so we're on our last section fostering your team culture and slack so far until now we've all been talking about kind of productivity tips how you can actually be more productive be more efficient and slack we talked about how to prepare for your launch day how to introduce your team to slack how to synchronize your user groups or set up user groups and some use cases on how to get started and of course how to install those apps that your team already uses so for the last portion which is going to be a bit shorter we're going to talk about how to actually use slack to make your working life more pleasant as well so a lot of you have already started doing this with the coffee bot and examples like that but slack is really useful for building relationships within your team I think more and more the way that the working world is changing is we're not communicating and working with each other in the same office how many of you regularly work with colleagues and other offices or other locations or maybe you're in a remote office that's a lot of us and so getting to know your teammates more personally helps you to feel a bit more engaged and actually brings all of you a bit closer together a story that I heard from a customer was yeah I introduced lack to my team because I'm a remote employee in Utah I used to be the last one to find out about anything now using slack we all find out at the same time together during the panel what I thought was really interesting was when I think it was Jay from Pixar talked about feedback and recognition and being able to highlight our colleagues when they're doing something great and also being inspired by it and so we like to give and track kudos in slack and we think that slack hopefully will help you do this a little bit more easily because feedback is something we want to do we want to be able to recognize each other when there's good work being done but it's not always easy to stop and do that so here are two examples on how you can do this in slack the one on the bottom here is a third-party app from our app store called grow bot and basically what it does is it tracks the highlight words props and kudos and any time that's tracked it's going to make a record of it it also tracks how many reactions those messages actually get so when it's time for performance reviews you're not thinking hey what kind of you know work did I do six months ago because that's not very easy to remember all the time you actually have a nice record of that throughout the entire time you were working with your team and slack but if you don't want to use a third-party app you can also very easily just do this negatively in slack by creating a kudos channel and just calling out your colleagues when they're doing great work or helping you out or anything like that someone mentioned an introductions channel we also have something similar we call it a yay Channel and we celebrate all fun things so anniversaries birthdays your first day at slack we also ask that you write a little blurb about yourself who you are where you're coming from which team you're on what your interests are and that kind of is a nice way for them to get to know other people in their team and lastly you know we're using slack for work and we're having a lot of conversations that are work-related but it's also nice to have some fun non-work-related channels as well we call these affinity groups and so someone in there yay intro might say I'm really into coffee and skiing and hiking you might very easily see someone say hey you should join our hiking channel or someone might say I just I have a two-year-old son he's not getting a lot of sleep lately they might invite you into the parent land channel which is a private channel where parents ask questions share best practices tips and tricks and commiserate about how little sleep they're getting so we're nearing the end here and someone mentioned it's hard to go find new restaurants around your office right you end up going to the same place again and again I go to Chipotle and fresh roll probably every single week so we'll wrap up with one last fun example Foursquare actually has a slash command in slack where you can do slash Foursquare type in your address or your air coordinates and it'll actually give you in the public channel a bunch of recommendations and then people can vote and choose their favorite restaurant for lunch that day which is pretty fun so let's recap because there was a lot of information that was shared today in sections 1 & 2 we really talked about how you can work in slack and how you can bring the rest of your team on to slack really thinking about ways to be more productive all those tips and tricks and hacks that I told you I love we gave you tips on staying focused how to manage the signal-to-noise ratio how to customize your notifications based on what you care about and then we talked about strategies for training your team and introducing them to slack for the first time getting the rest of your team on board and then finally we talked about ways to grow your team culture and slack and how slack potentially help with that I hope this was helpful for you this was great I really appreciate you guys joining and participating in the conversation I learned a bunch I hope this was helpful for you I think next we have time for networking and just having fun we also have our help desk which is just around the corner so if you have any deeper dive questions about anything we cover please come and find us there hey you\n",

costs with automation be more efficient with productivity tools and so so much more as always you can learn more on Trailhead salesforce's online learning platform for more information on this topic and many others that you might find useful for your business now it's no secret that Global organizations are tightening their budgets fortunately there are digital first solutions that Empower organizations and teams to work faster and get more value out of their already made Investments meet Slack slack connects your people tools customers and partners for faster and more flexible work consider it the command center of your workday here are four easy to use tips that you can use in slack right now to help you reclaim focus and preserve your most precious resource time tip number one replace meetings this first tip is all about how we can cancel meetings while getting more work done in recent years the number of meetings workers attend has risen by an average of 13.5 percent according to the Harvard Business review the study also found employee productivity was 71 percent higher when meetings were reduced by 40 percent clearly cutting back on meetings is key to seeing productivity gains One Way organizations are reducing meetings is by using slack to communicate in real time in fact 83 percent of employees preferred using tools like slack over traditional one-to-one meetings because it saved them time and that beautiful calendar space now don't worry we're not saying that you should cancel all your meetings but since they are your company's most expensive means of collaboration they should definitely be used intentionally slack offers too simple yet powerful solutions to reduce the amount of meetings on your calendar first up we have Clips you can send video or audio messages right inside a slack Clips offers a flexible alternative to meetings because others can watch when it's convenient for them they can adjust the playback speed they can Emoji react reply and threads and best of all the clips are automatically transcribed so everything you say is searchable it's amazing now if you're wondering when to use this feature clip saves our team's Time by replacing full length meetings for things like status updates and design feedback and sharing ideas they also allow teams in different time zones to work together more easily more seamlessly and without asking people to be logged on beyond their working hours second we have huddles huddles are a lightweight and audio first way to communicate right inside of Slack with just the click of a button you can invite an entire Channel a group of people or even just a single person into a Live Sync and the best part is my favorite part there's no pressure to meet for a certain amount of time like those dreaded 60 Minute calendar blocks that we all know about that way you can meet for however long is needed to get the job done and then move on huddles also allow for multi-person screen sharing a dedicated thread to take notes and animated emoji and stickers so we can make virtual get-togethers that much more enjoyable here at Salesforce and slack we love using huddles to reduce formal meetings especially for things like debriefs reviews troubleshooting or brainstorming tip number two replace emails our next tip is about your inbox which right now is probably overflowing with unwanted and unnecessary emails when work gets busy communication can get messy email threads start to pile up and then they're filled with those one-word responses missing attachments and an ever expanding list of people to CC I mean do people even still use BCC anymore I don't know the good news is with slack emails at Salesforce are down 42 from fy21 so let's explore the three ways that we can rid ourselves of the email nightmare once and for all with slack channels slack Channel benefit number one channels organize your work in a way that makes sense to you instead of one crowded inbox for every single individual reply slack channels organize your work around a specific topic team or project so all your teams files and history are all in one convenient location slack Channel benefit number two channels provide transparency and they improve alignment by giving you and your team a shared view of the work that's being done so no information gets lost in someone's inbox Silo no one gets left out of the loop and new project members when they join they have full context and slack Channel benefit number three channels create a searchable library of knowledge so content in slack channels is searchable that means that there's no need to forward a bunch of emails ping a bunch of co-workers or spend hours digging in different places for that one thing that you've been looking for tip number three use automation from Fielding requests to getting new team members in the know our work days are filled with manual yet necessary tasks that can slow productivity to a halt Slack's workflow Builder gives anyone and I mean anyone in your company the tools to simplify and automate that work in fact 77 of Service agents say that automating routine tasks allows them to focus on more complex work according to a recent Salesforce state of service report Slack's workflow Builder is a visual tool that allows any user to automate routine tasks by creating custom workflows in just a few minutes you can have a seamless way to standardize how you collect requests from your team to report any outage in real time to get new team members up to speed with welcome messages and so so much more you can even create workflows that automatically send information to tools like jira Salesforce Google Sheets and Trello and you can pull information from these apps into slack now if the word automation sounds intimidating don't worry workflow Builder is a no code tool and most people who regularly use it are non-technical including me tip number four reduce context switching alright for our final productivity tip let's talk about context switching now a recent study from Harvard found that many employees are toggling between tools about 1200 times per day think about how much time that adds up to over a week a month a year I mean that's a lot of wasted time thanks to Slack's ability to keep your attention in one place businesses on average experience up to 26 percent faster decision making as a result and thankfully slack connects with many of your favorite apps and tools so you can spend less time juggling screens and more time doing meaningful work with apps and slack you can do amazing things like quickly find share and act on information create and respond to calendar events receive real-time updates collaborate on files speed up incident resolution and so much more Salesforce customer 360 also seamlessly integrates with slack so your teams don't have to switch between tools or Salesforce Solutions Now teams across sales service and marketing can share a single view of the customer and have unified conversations about different accounts opportunities campaigns and more all within slack so to sum up tip 4 spend less time switching screens and more time doing meaningful things wow we have covered so much great content in this video to recap slack reduces unnecessary meetings emails manual tasks and context

            "just jump up here, let’s add a graphic which will be this one here—I’m going to copy\n",

            "Slack and let’s go and watch what happens if I paste that link in to a conversation. It looks like a Dropbox link. “Do you want us to import it and all future\n",

communication software slack is headquartered on Fifth Street in San Francisco just a couple blocks south of Market Street it shares a building with Eventbrite which we toured for cribs a few months back I met with an to Slack's VP of policy to get a tour of the space so we have um a large open Office Space as you can see we have folks working at their desks over here we actually have uh we split folks out by generally speaking by their sound tolerance so we have some folks who like quiet work spaces and some folks who like it a little louder and when you have a big open Office it can be really hard to keep it sort of a low hum for everybody right so we've just sort of grouped people by their um by the nature of their work and what they do and so that they can make noise if they need to or they can keep it quiet and work in a more sort of peaceful environment so is this alloud section no actually the alloud section will end on over there over here we have a variety of our engineering staff that starts over here and goes around the corner and you guys have moved a lot over the past few months it seems like slack has been growing quickly and you keep kind of moving to New spaces how long have you been here what's the situation so it's been a little bit over a month we moved in April uh prior to that we were in an office on fulam okay um I joined there in October I was around the 50th or so employee and when we left uh we completely eaten that space it was unbelievable how we packed ourselves in Slack's office is 50,000 Square ft with 30 conference rooms and a large Cafe area with a coffee station and a juice bar we are entering into what for a lot of people is uh the heart of any home and any workspace is kind of the kitchen where people eat and gather and hang out during the day oh nice you guys have this is a good happy hour spot is that Jared letto it is if you want to um come over this way so uh so Jared Leto is one of the investors in slack and also an academy award-winning actor so he came by with his Oscar and that's Cal Henderson with Stuart in the background uh two of our co-founders with some extra um emphasis added on the eyes yeah the googly eyes really make it yeah yeah we think so you'll find some googly eyes on a lot of things throughout the building it's kind of a little uh a little Easter egg around here we actually do a couple things over here I wanted to point out uh this is our bar setup so we have happy hour here every Thursday we we cater it we make sure that actually one of the most important things is that they are mocktails for people who don't drink so there's a little bit of everything for everybody but one of the things you might notice um people have gone a little nuts with the label maker so this is our book about cocktails right there uh in case you weren't sure uh the other breakfast the most important meal of the day this is awesome and this is hamster food so you know people are uh pretty open about expressing their views on the various food items apparently Special K with strawberries very popular here would you like a cup of coffee I would love a cup of coffee all right slack intentionally doesn't have nap rooms foosball tables or free meals that's because it encourages its employees to experience life outside of work the company believes that its staff does its best during work hours when they're able to really recharge on average slack employees are in their early 30s which means that more people on staff have kids and commitments outside of the office I'll go in and then I'll come out dressed as a superhero that's what's going to happen okay okay can you hear me I'm talk well I guess you can cuz I have my mic on so uh so we have Emoji themed conference rooms every single one is has a different symbol um and we even in the in the in our booking tool you book based on emoji so I can show you some okay this is our training room right here this one is rocket we have these lovely iPads that sit outside so you can book the room and see who's using it and when it's available next right which is very convenient very nice money bag it's interesting that there such a small room yeah well you know sometimes a lot of these are used for interviewing or for phone screening and what have you so they don't have to be large sometimes you just need a quiet place to talk and this is where you can get that done without disrupting your other colleagues totally okay hand y right there some of these Emoji have different cultural conations I've discovered I didn't know okay up totally good here maybe not so good in Brazil I'm not not sure but there's our thumbs up right here um and some of these are equipped with quite a nice audio visual setup we use zoom um to do conferencing across our different offices and right because you guys have offices in Vancouver and Dublin yes we do so very we do let me show you our bike space right here for storage so uh a lot of our employees here in San Francisco commute in by bicycle because they live here in the city y um we have a variety of different commuter benefits but uh but a lot of folks really prefer to ride their bike and that actually is also there's a commuter benefit associated with biking even we give you a little uh benefit for that so people come in and you can see they they hook up their bikes here we have a shower people can um take care of all the stuff they need to right here yeah you have a little baby seat in the back I know you know you got some young employees here I like it we have some young employees we have no the bab the baby doesn't come to work with his mom but uh but yeah it's nice that they commute together I think that's really great yeah well thank you so much for showing us around this has been awesome you're welcome you're welcome cheers\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: [Music] hello everybody and welcome back to video 2 in the slack bot tutorial series so in this video we're going to be talking about events so how can we actually subscribe to events now what that means is that right now all we're really able to do is send a message we can do a few other things as well we could like pin a message react to it but we're not able to see what's happening inside of these channels we don't know what other people are doing we can't really see if someone else sends a message and a lot of the times when we have a bot what we want to do is be able to do something when a user you know runs some command or does something specific in the channel maybe they say a swear word and we want to delete that message right that's an example of something that we could do so what we need to do is set up a way for our bot to be kind of alerted or be aware when something happens in this channel now this is somewhat complicated in terms of how this actually works for our implementation it's not going to be that difficult but what we need to do is go back to the slack api page and we need to go here to where it says event subscriptions and start setting up a few things so that we're subscribed to these events so what i'm going to do is go ahead and turn enable events on now notice that the first thing it asked me for here is a request url now what this is saying essentially is that when an event occurs the slack api is going to send a post request which is just a method of an http request essentially to our web server so what we're going to be doing is we're actually going to be running our bot which we're not doing right now on a web server now running on a web server just simply means that this is going to be sitting and it's going to be running 24 7 and it's going to have its own kind of url right just like a website you know if i go to techwithtim.net that's running on a web server and when i go there it returns some html and it renders that on my screen well this is going to work a little bit differently what's going to happen is we're going to be running on a web server it's not going to be a website just a web server and when an event happens it's going to send a request to that web server and then we can handle that request and we can do something with it so for example when a user sends a message we can send a message back or we can say hello or something like that so to do this we need to start by doing a few different things the first thing we need to do is install a tool called ngrok so ngrok the reason for this is that we're going to run our web server on our local computer at least for right now when we distribute this bot later on we will run this on like a public web server that everyone can access but for right now we're running it on our local computer so we need to go ahead and install this software called ngrok which will essentially allow us to take a public ip address or a public domain and route that to our local web server so you just need to go ahead and press download here this is completely free there is a paid version but we don't need that and then if you're on windows obviously download for windows if you're on mac and linux download for those respective platforms now there is some instructions here you may have to do a few different things if you're on linux or mac os you can check that out right here but download that and then make sure you keep track of where that file is downloaded because this software works a little bit differently than we may have used before anyways mine is stored inside of my downloads folder so if i go to downloads you can see i have ngrok right here make sure you unzip that folder and then just take the application file and put it somewhere where you're going to remember in fact you could actually put it right inside of here if you wanted to it's going to be hard for me to run it in this directory but of course you could put it there if you wanted to all right so the next thing we're going to need to do is install a few more packages from pip so since we're going to be running a web server we're going to use a module called flask which is a really lightweight micro web service is what it's called to actually run this server so we're going to say pip install flask like that now again you can see i already have this satisfied for you guys it should install a bunch of different things and then the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to say pip install and then slack events api so i'll leave that up right there and you guys can see what that is but this is what we're going to use to actually handle and grab the events coming from slack so now that we have these two things installed come on finish up there we're going to go ahead and modify some things in our python file and then we'll go back to the slack api page and we'll add a few different things the first thing we're going to do is we're going to say from flask import flask with a capital like that then right after we initiate the client or before it doesn't actually matter where we do it we can say app equals then we're going to say flask and then underscore underscore name underscore underscore this is simply just a variable that's inside of python it represents the name of the file you don't i don't need to explain why we need that but this is just how we configure our flask application now it's super easy to run our flask application what we can do is we can set up this if statement at the bottom of our program and say if underscore underscore name underscore underscore equals and then inside of strings underscore underscore main underscore underscore simply we can do app dot run and then we can say debug equals true now what this is going to do is take our flask application it's going to run it on the default port which i believe is port 5000. if you want to change the port that this is running on you can say port equals and then set that to some integer value that's not already being used but what the debug does is say okay if we save this file or we modify it we don't need to re-run the python script it will automatically re-run it for us it will automatically update the web server which is really nice when we're doing development and then what this is saying here is essentially if we didn't import this file if we actually ran this file directly that's essentially what this if statement says then go ahead and run the web server the reason for that is if we imported this from another file we probably don't want to run the web server when we're you know taking a variable or something like that from this file all right so now we have that the next thing we're going to do is we're going to say from slack events api import slack event adapter now this is kind of a weird thing it's hard for me to explain exactly what this is going to do but this is going to handle all of the events for us so after we make the app and make sure it's after what we're going to do is say slack underscore event underscore adapter like that is equal to slack event adapter and then inside of here what we're going to need to do is pass something something and then our app so i'll talk to you about what these two things are in a second actually we can do the middle thing we're going to say slash slack slash events but for this one we're going to need to pass what's known as a signing secret which we're going to have to grab from the slack api website what this is saying is okay we're going to add the slack event adapter this event adapter will allow us to handle the different events that are being sent to us from the slack api and what we're going to do is say okay we want this route right here so slash slack slash events to be where we send all of those different events to and app is saying okay what web server are we sending these events to well we're sending it to this app which is the current running web server hopefully that makes sense but let's go back to the slack website slack api we're going to go to basic information and scroll down and there's this thing called our signing secret now what i'm going to do is well i'm going to have this blurred out but i'm going to copy this signing secret i'm going to go into my env file and just like i made this slack token i'm going to say signing underscore secret equals and then i'm going to set it equal to that token that i just grabbed that secret that i just grabbed now just like we did previously what we're going to do is use the os dot environ or whatever you want to call this to grab the signing secret from that file so i'm just going to copy this here i'm going to paste that as our first argument to the slack event adapter so now instead of slack token i'm going to say signing oops in all capitals underscore secret like that so there you go i saved and you can see now it kind of went down on the next line we have slack event adapter signing secret the route we want to go to and then app all right now this is where it gets a little bit more complicated but nothing crazy so what we're going to do is go ahead and run this i just want to make sure i didn't mess anything up too badly i actually think that we are good okay so i'm going to go ahead and run this and notice that now we can see that we have a web server running and we get kind of all of this output so it says right now that we are running on http colon 127.0.0.1 colon 5000 so that's just localhost right but what i want you to keep track of here is this port this port is important because we're going to need to use this in the next step so in my case i'm on 5000 you're probably on 5000 as well but if you see a different number here then swap what i do in the next step with that number so what we're going to do now is go and find where that ngrok program was and just double click it to run it now if you're on mac or linux you're going to have to go back to the ngrok website and kind of follow the instructions for that it's not very complicated but you just need to essentially run that program so i'm going to go and double click ngrok and then now i'm inside of cmd what i'm going to do is i'm going to type ngrok and lowercase like that also i have no idea if that's how you pronounce it so i apologize if i've been butchering this the whole time you're going to type http and then you're going to type the number for the port that your server is running on so in this case ngrok http 5000. i'm going to go ahead and press enter and when i do that you're going to see that we have all of this kind of stuff popping up here and what i want you to look for is where it says forwarding so essentially what we've just done by running this program is we've allowed this public ip address which is this http blah blah blah blah to point to our local host web server so we can use this on the internet to kind of test and debug our app and this will point to this localhost address right here now keep in mind just because this is the free version of the software whenever you re-run this tool and you do need to keep this running you can't close this window you need to keep it running the entire time this address will change so what the paid version does for you is it lets you have a permanent address for this so it doesn't constantly change for us that doesn't matter this is just for development purposes anyways but copy this address it doesn't really matter if you use the https or the http i'll just use the http again this doesn't really matter at all we're going to go back to the slack api website here and what i'm going to do now is i'm going to go back to events so let me find where that is event subscription and now we're going to enable events and where it says request url we're going to put that url that we just copied we're going to put slash slack and then slash events now once we do that we're going to go and go to subscribe to bot events we're going to add the events inside of here that we want to subscribe to so in this case i'm going to go add bot user event and what i want to do now is i want to have channels and i want to do message dot channels what this will do is allow me to be subscribed to all of the events where a user messages something in a specific channel what will happen when someone sends a message is it will send a request to this url which in turn will hit our local server because we've rerouted that using ngrok and then we'll be able to do something with that so i'm going to go ahead and press save changes and now it says you've changed the permission scopes for your apps please reinstall your app for these changes to take effect now it also says right here that we need channels colon history as a required scope for this to work so remember back in the first video what we did is we went to oauth and permissions and what we needed to do is add the channel history scope where we added chat right now this automatically added this scope for us because we added that event subscription but just so you know say for some reason it didn't add it it showed you what you need to add you could go here and add that and then reinstall the app but anyways we're going to do is press reinstall app again we'll just press allow and we're good to go and now we can get out of this page we can go back to our vs code and we can continue to write all right so just note if i go here to ngrok we have a request that's come in here that says post slash slack slash events what this is saying is that we have just actually received a request because we just put that url in right and it was verifying that url was correct to this endpoint right here which is slash slack slash events now keep in mind that the reason why if i go back to the api page i just want to make sure this is really clear let's go back to event subscription the reason why i added the slash slack slash events here is because this address right here points to our local host and what i did inside of the code here is i said okay i want all of the events to be sent to this endpoint so that's why i added that there now if i change this like events one i would have to go back here and change ngrok to slash slack slash events one right i would add a one at the end there anyways we don't need that but let's go back to that all right so now that we have that what we need to do is create a route to create a function that can actually handle all of these events so i'm going to say at slack vent adapter and sorry not that we're going to do the one at slack underscore event adapter so the variable we set up here we're gonna say dot on and then inside of here we're gonna say message now this is simply what we use to handle the on message event so when a message is sent we're to handle that we're going to do something inside of here so i'm going to say define message i'm going to take a payload here and then inside of here we'll do a few different things now what this is saying is that when a message is sent we're going to call this function and we're going to take the payload that was sent to us the payload is just some data that the slack api is going to send in this case it's going to send us all of the data about the specific message that was sent so what i'm going to do is say event equals payload dot get and then inside of here i'm going to say event comma and then just an empty dictionary like that what this is saying is let's look for the key event inside of our payload if we don't have that we'll return a blank dictionary the event key is going to give us information again about what that event was and like the message that was sent all of the text and all of that now the first thing that we can do is we can see what channel this message was sent in so i can say channel id is equal to event dot get and then instead of here i can say channel what this will do is give me the channel id that whatever message was sent in right so pretty straightforward next i can say user id so user id equals event.get and then in this case i can say user pretty straightforward it's going to give me the id of the user that sent this message and again we're getting that from the event key in the payload next what i'm going to do is say text equals event dot gets take a wild guess at what this is going to be it is simply text and there we go so what i'm going to do now is simply echo back to the user whatever they send us so we'll use this client.chat underscore post message so we'll go ahead and put that like that and what we will do is we'll say okay when you post a message sorry when we receive a message we will simply send back whatever that message was so i will change the text here to be text which means whatever was sent to us we will send back and then the channel i will simply change to be the channel id so say channel equals channel id and now whenever a message is sent we will send back another message that simply echoes it so let's save that i might have made a mistake here but let's run this code okay so we're running the server have a look at ngrok oops i want to close that i keep opening that wrong one and you'll see all of the events that are coming in but let's go back to slack in this case we're gonna go actually back to our slack channel and now i'm gonna send something i'm gonna send hi and notice that the youtube bot keeps returning hi now we kind of have a problem here right it's just constantly sending back high and if i go to ngrok here you can see that we just keep getting all these requests coming in and it just keeps telling us that messages were sent now the reason why we continue to send high is because if we have a look at our code here all we've actually done is just handled the situation where a message was sent right if any message was sent it doesn't matter by who even our own bot then we're going to send a message back so what we need to do is we need to make sure that when we send a message we're only sending it if the previous message was not from us right so we don't want to reply to a message that was ourself so what we're going to do is check to see if the message event that we're getting sent here is from a bot or if it's from our self now to do this what we need to do and actually let me just stop the server for a second because they're just going to keep going so let's just do control c and i'll stop that there we need to check if the user id of this message is equal to our bot's id but that means we need to know our bot's id so the first thing we're going to do is say bot underscore id i'm going to do this above the function is equal to client dot api call now this is another way that we can call specific endpoints on the slack api if you know about that then this will be useful if not don't worry about it no problem but we're going to say client dot api underscore call i'm going to say auth.test now what this is going to do is return to us again some information one of those pieces of information will be the id of our bot so to get that we're going to say user underscore id now don't worry if this is confusing you just imagine that all this line is doing is giving us the id of our bot so we can simply check if the user id here is equal to the id of our bot if it is we're just not going to send the message so we'll say if the bot underscore id does not equal the user id then we'll go ahead and send that message so let's save that let's run the server and i need a colon here that's going to be syntax error let's add the colon expect an indented block that should be indented as well my apologies but let's run that now we can see this is all running let's go back to slack and let's send hello world give it a second and notice that our bot returns hello world but it doesn't just keep sending hello world now let's say hi i am tim and we get hi i am tim so that is the basics and that is how we subscribe to events now of course there is all kinds of other events as well if you have a look here of subscribe to bot events you can kind of scroll through and just pick whatever events you want it will add automatically add that scope and then all you'll need to do is maybe just do a quick lookup to figure out how or what the string is here that you need to pass in to handle that specific event but if you want another event you would just write the exact same thing i've done here the payload may be slightly different that's coming in but you can get the same information like the channel the user the text you can get the time there's a bunch of other stuff that you can get in fact to conclude here i will just print out what the payload looks like so you guys can have an idea of what we're actually being returned here so let's say print payload like that let's go into our console let's go to slack and let's send a message hello world and you can see if we have a look here we get the payload right so we have all this stuff coming in so this is all the information that it's passing us now you can kind of parse through this information on your own and get all of the stuff that you want but you can just print it out and kind of have a look at you know what you're actually getting back from the api so anyways i think i'm going to end the video here hopefully that showed you how we can handle messages and give you kind of some intuition on how you would handle other events in the future we will handle some other events but i'm going to be trying to show you a bunch of

            "people, let alone hundreds or thousands. The amount of will that has to go in,\n",
            "the amount of like selling, the amount of vision, the amount\n",
            "of like coercion and cajoling, and the amount of encouragement, and support. All of those things is just enormous. So, the game does change as the company\n",
            "gets bigger and things evolve. And I think probably only\n",
            "gets more difficult, but. That's what I've been\n",

            "I get a head of sales reports to me, head of marketing reports to me,\n",
            "head of finance reports to me, our general counsel reports to me. So I have a very different perspective\n",
            "than what is ultimately relatively narrow. And generally,\n",
            "a better idea of what we need to do. because I also talk to customers more\n",
            "than pretty much anyone else other than the sales person. And I talk to our investors\n",
            "more than anyone else. And I talk to our board\n",
            "more than anyone else. Yeah, it's really, but I think there are better sources\n",

            "multiplayer workplace software. I mean, that's kind of the principal\n",

            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: my goal is that by the end of this video you will not only know how to set up and use slack if you haven't already but you will become an absolute slack master knowing how to use certain automations and features that 99 of slack users don't know how to use and how to leverage it to run your entire company from your phone just like i do slack is a channel based messaging platform that allows users to work together more effectively connect all their software tools and services and easily find the information they need to do their best work what that means is slack is your one-stop shop to get rid of email communicate with your team manage your clients and run your company what's going on everyone i'm ravi abubala founder of scaling with systems and i use slack inside of both of my companies in order to manage over 35 employees as well as keep updated on customer payments booked appointments new leads client onboarding and so much more not only that but i've taught over 800 entrepreneurs how to leverage slack and how they can run their entire business from it during the setup phase of this video i will be creating a slack account from scratch so you can see how you can set it up most optimally for success however when we come to the more advanced part of this video training i'm going to show you inside of my slack account for the first time live and show you how we use it to run all of our companies and manage all of our team members whether you're currently communicating with your team members through outdated methods like email or you think that you're a slack pro i guarantee you that there is something in this video for everyone as usual if you get any value out of this video whatsoever do me a quick favor and just smash that like button it takes .001 seconds and make sure you subscribe to the channel so you can get notified when my next video drops with that being said let's dive right into your most comprehensive guide to using slack all right guys so now i am over here at slack.com and i'm just going to go ahead and assume that most people watching this video right now actually don't already have slack set up if you do just give me a few seconds here i'm going to show them how to set this up and then we're going to dive into the really good stuff like optimizing it setting up automations how to run your company from it but as i said you can see we're at slack.com here if this is your first time setting up there's going to be your page going to look similar to this and there's going to be a button probably really similar to try for free so we're going to click that and then obviously two options here continue with google or enter your work email in here and then if you do have a company workspace already you can just click on that and you will actually be able to um sign in with your company email and it should move you straight into the new company workspace but i'm going to say here that i'm actually starting this company up for the first time and we're just going to use one of my email accounts that's i will have this set up perfect we're going to click continue and then they're sending a code to my email so i'm going to really quickly open up my email slack confirmation okay great and after you entered it in here you're going to say create a new slack workspace and so that's what we're going to want to do um obviously you can see i have one of my companies right down below but we're going to create a new workspace you can uncheck that if you don't want them to continuously send you emails so let's click create a workspace so what's the name of your company or team you can name it anything you really want for your company my advertising agency is called prospect social so i can name it that but you can also name it you know reviews team or my other one's called scaling with systems or another really great one is subscribe [Music] now okay okay so let's just call it that uh and then we'll say let anyone with a prospect social email join this workspace so that just means that if you set up a new prospect social email just like i showed you before when you said sign into an existing workspace they'd be able to easily do that so i actually don't like to keep that on just because i don't want somebody you know if i have them as a contractor and i don't necessarily want them inside of there whatever it is i'd rather just invite them which i'm going to show you how to do that later so i'm going to click next here um what's your team working right now so in this step this is going to be setting up essentially um starting to set up your channels so this is going to be what we're kind of communicating with inside of slack so it could be something like sales um could be something like marketing [Music] could be something like advertising client fulfillment etc cetera and i don't know how to spell so we're going to quickly change that perfect next uh what do who do you email most about client fulfillment so they're kind of walking you through the channels aspect over here so i could just say i want to email my friend mel jane at prospect social.com one of my team members i could add as many people as one or if i just want to do a company-wide blast i could get a shareable link copy it to my email and just send that link to everybody right there okay so let's click add teammates awesome and then they're gonna do a quick little walkthrough for you uh really here so this is essentially the rundown of what slackit so this is inside of the slack dashboard as you can see right here this is the company name obviously subscribe now if you haven't already uh underneath that as well you can see what our channels are now channels are essentially just the little imagine them as little pockets or conversations that you can have with your team members i'm going to show you how valuable that is when you have as many team members as many channels as i do but it's so that you don't lose a conversation an email imagine this you're having a conversation with an employee or a contractor or a client over email and then they also call you and then they also text you and they send you a message on facebook and a message on instagram and all of a sudden you don't really know where that piece of information was that they had given to you and it gets really easy to kind of get lost with all of that well the nice thing about channels is you keep all of the conversations about that specific topic in that channel so everything client fulfillment would be inside of here so i'd be like hey you know did we get this client set up on time and i could put that inside of there and then you know someone else would come back one of my team members could say yes you know and then they they could send that to me and then later on if that client wasn't set up i'd be able to come back inside of the client fulfillment channel and say hey james sarah bob bill you know you said that they were set up why is it not set up right so it's a really great way to keep everyone accountable it's a really great way to um to kind of have a almost an archive of every conversation you've had organized which we're going to get into in a second so those are essentially what channels are they kind of come with a few uh ones i i usually honestly kind of get rid of the ones that i don't want which you can come here and click more and you either leave or if you're the the founder of the channel additional options and i don't ever delete channels i just archive them because deleting you can never get back archiving you can um you can still be able to see the past messages inside of there okay so uh really quickly like i said client fulfillment this is my little avatar if i wanted to i could click edit profile here and i can change my name to ravi abubala i can upload an image of something that is maybe a little bit more flattering than this purple person right here i can add my phone number or anything else i want to do so let's and you can see that updates that right there in addition to that you can see inside the channel this is a little box that you can send messages to people you can type hey everyone and then you could just like kind of some of the social media channels when you click at you can start tagging specific people in there so this is mel jane the person i i um i added in here earlier or you can say something like at channel and it will notify everybody inside that channel okay other cool little things bold italic you know strikethrough you have coding if you want to add that aspect in here as well you can add links bullets everything you can imagine pretty much is inside of your emojis you can attach large files you even have gifs in here and you can add different apps as well which we'll get into kind of a little bit later okay so that's essentially how you use the bottom browser here some of the cool things i like to do personally is like something like you know people don't really know this actually right off the bat here but you can click slash and you can click remind and then you can set a reminder for yourself so remind me in four days to check back in on you know client a okay and then in four days it will give me a reminder to check back in on client a or the other thing is slash remind you know mel jane one of my team members to check the application status of clients b right um oh i didn't get that right you see sometimes oh check that in four days there we go and so you can see all your reminders right there so that's some cool stuff you can kind of do inside of slack and i'll show you some other really really cool stuff when we get inside mine which has all the bells and whistles in it on the right hand side here this is when i go up and click info about the channel so inside of a channel here i can call people inside of the channel and then people can hop in which is actually pretty cool add people find certain keywords inside of here so let's type in the word clients oh do we get that client set up on time maybe i type in clients you know b oh client a there you do we get this client set up on time so you can kind of see how that's used inside of here you can set an about if you want to and edit the description i don't usually do that you see the members inside of it you can pin post add files et cetera et cetera as i showed you earlier you know some of the things i do because you know i have a team of 20 plus people i'll mute some channels because i need access to the channel but i don't want to keep on getting notified of it all the time i can jump to a specific date where a conversation happen uh you know you can add apps copy the channel name rename the channel and then the final few things is just like i said earlier archiving this channel you can change it to a private channel which i actually do for some things if it's you know i don't want everyone in the company to have access to it like expenses or receipts or you know it could be employee reviews and i don't want everybody to be able to see that and then like i said delete or archive is going to be in here as well and then the final thing that you can do the channel is leave the channel so you can leave it and that way other people still have access to it however you're not gonna have you're not gonna essentially need access to it anymore okay so underneath channels the final thing with channels as well is that you can just click add channels right here create a new channel and you can add let's just say you know advertising okay and then you click create and you can add you know all the members or you can add specific people let's just say i want to add mel jane back inside of here again we click add okay so now we're in advertising and then you could add multiple channels another little kind of hack once you get a bunch of channels which i'll show you later on is to add like a specific thing in front of it so maybe sales and then it could be um you know sales qualifying call and then you could create one that was like at all members create a new channel sales demonstration call so if you add this little the words at the beginning of it here like sales it'll keep these things uh together so that they're all organized on this dashboard together as well as the client fulfillment let's say i wanted to add a new one and it could be something like client complaints and that will that will keep all these things kind of together here okay so let's just clean this up let's get rid of the random one because i don't think we have any really need for that yes i want to archive it um and we'll keep the advertising one there and then you can so you guys are starting to understand how this will work and it becomes real magic as i show you some of the other stuff if we come down here to direct messages um these are the conversations that you can have with other teammates directly i try not to have too many conversations inside of here because it's not i want everybody to be able to see it with a full transparency company and i like to keep things like i said organized inside of these channels or there's really no point of this thing in the first place okay so uh you can message something over here like you know something personal like hey happy birthday um or whatever you wanted to send over there but realistically you should keep things as much as you can inside of these channels up top now probably for one of my favorite features of slack is the search bar right here i had referenced it earlier but i want to make sure you guys really understand the power of this because this is one of the main reasons why you get off email and you get start using slack is because you can start having anything you can i'll show you when i get into my slack channel but you can say stuff like a client's name and see all the information about that client's name you can say yourself like an employee's name and see all the information about an employee's main you can say stuff like facebook ads or google ad and see all the conversations that have been had you know if you typed in a leads name you could see if you had it set up correctly every single interaction they've had with your business so when they opted in when they submitted an application when they had their sales call when they had their proposal sent out all that stuff so you can kind of document someone's journey from a to z all inside of slack so that's the really cool thing about the search bar in here i would argue it is the most powerful the feature of slack and i would recommend everybody here use it and the final thing about slack is just if you click the channel name up here you can see subscribe now and what you can do is invite people right here you click invite people you can add their name or you can just send an invite link and then send it out to people that's if you want to add additional team members you can create channels here if you go to preferences i'm not going to go too deep in here because obviously you can just decide what you want preferences to be but you know you can also say if you want notifications on slack or not which i think is really important so that you don't have uh you know people blowing you up at 11 o'clock at night 12 o'clock at night except especially if you're like us and you have team members in multiple time zones as well um and let's get back over here and then the final few things is settings and administration workplace settings inside of here you can go really deep in this slack has some great training on that i'm not going to get into too much on that you can customize manage the members kick out members if you need to change their you know change their features you know change them from the primary owner to something else change them to admins et cetera et cetera and um the there's an analytics tab inside of here which you can kind of see how many messages you've sent what files are stored apps and integrations active members all this kind of stuff so i i'm not really inside of here too much but it could be something interesting if you're if you want that kind of information and the final thing is going to be the pricing that i want to cover for just the beginners in this video and that is going to be choose the plan that's right for your team so when you get i think 10 000 searchable um messages inside slack so that's really really valuable but the downside of that is at some point you will not be able to find information anymore because it's going to be too far in the past so you think 10 000 messages a lot but if you're doing any kind of the work that i'm about to show you then it's going to be a lot less than you think and you're going to need to upgrade as soon as possible so i do recommend it as soon as you can there's a standard version here and there's a plus version here you can kind of decide most people will be able to use the free one uh with ten thousand search messages ten apps and one on one video calls for a good bit of time and then i'll be honest with you with a 20 plus person team we still use um the standard package here so the plus is for those that are seeking like administration tools and some larger company setups or the enterprise gold but i'd say about for 95 percent of people that are watching this video right now you should just be able to use the standard package okay so with that all being said i'm going to pull up my slack inside of here now and show you guys what it looks like and how we've set it up for success inside of my company all right guys so like i said we are inside of our slack channel now inside of my company scaling with systems one of the companies i have as you can see we have about 24 members up there up top and i'm going to show you how we leverage slack or how i personally leverage slack to run this company day in day out so obviously this is the general channel here you can see we have people that post at the end of every single day the things that they did i'll probably blur some of this stuff out here just uh you know to keep the privacy of my employees but you can see that they comment the things that they did every single day so i'm able to review are they being efficient or not i'm going to really quickly start at the top and go down and show you some few cool ones that we kind of leverage one of the first ones channels that we use that we really love is called booked appointments so this is something i teach all of this for my clients inside of scaling with systems i set this all up for them but so booked appointments is how we can actually see as you can see in here whenever someone books on our sales teams calendar we can see where they came from we can see what ad they were watching what targeting they had you know who referred them over if someone did and that way i kind of get a general idea of what the flow of new appointments are like inside of our company and you can set that up with a integration using an app called zapier z api er i will actually link the card up top here of a video i have showing how to do this already so i would just right click that open that up in a new video but don't leave this one because we're not done yet so we actually also on top of that attach in their application for their booked appointments as well so you can see inside of here i can we can be able to tell right from the back what are the quality appointments from this lead source you know what is his appointment looking like should be we be working with them should we not be et cetera et cetera okay so that's all inside of the book deployment channel gives me a good flow of things that are coming in and out of the company same thing with book disco so these are for our discovery calls uh for our sales team so we book discovery calls of people every single day dozens and dozens of discovery calls and exact same thing right we have numbers we have uh you know in information on the person we have applications of all that kind of stuff now a few other things that i recommend people having inside of theirs i have an email channel here once again we'll blur some of this stuff out but you can see inside of here i am having my assistant selena she drops in some of the most important emails that i only be checking every single day so i think that if you're a business owner you should not be checking email i really i tell my clients at inside scaling with systems i really think it's kind of a waste of time and it's a good way to ruin your day to be honest with you so easily delegatable so i'd recommend you do delegate that out to a virtual assistant like we teach our clients at scaling systems or somebody else and then what they can do is if somebody is wanting to reach you or it's in a more important email they can drop it inside of slack and that way you can just respond inside of here but the cool thing is i've taught selena well and so she pretty much filters 99 of the stuff and then only the really important stuff do we keep inside of the channel here she drops inside the channel so a few other channels i think are important so we have a appointment setter channel inside of here so whenever our appointment setter he is confirming appointments the morning of he's a virtual assistant then they can actually go inside of here and say hey did they confirm do they not confirm so my sales team knows should they be showing up for this call or should we cancel this appointment beforehand okay uh another kind of cool thing i won't click on these channels because they're pretty private but um you can actually connect other outside members uh outside channels inside of here so if we go down here and we click create a channel what we can do is actually click this share outside of scaling with systems and then what we can do is actually share the channel with outside companies or outside contractors so they can stay inside of their slack i stay in my inside of my slack and it's very very organized okay so i do have that with a few of our advertising media buyers as you can see inside of here and then when we come down two of my other favorite channels that i have are called payment failed once again this will be blurred out but we use that software called zapier i'd reference earlier to send in a notification anytime one of our clients has a payment that fails so it says hey this client this email failed their this amount of payments please reach out or they're going to lose access to the program right and then we have a list a google documents list of everyone that's delinquents and this allows my customer success manager allows our sales people allows everybody to know hey is this person late why are they late we need to jump back in figure something out and get them back on track for their payments and then same thing for payment success so as you can see in here as well we had a payment come through today this will also be blurred out but we had a payment come in today and so this will all also let me know without having to sign in to anywhere else because remember that is the goal i don't want to have to sign it anywhere else i can see how much money is coming into my company what's the cash flow coming in every single day all right we also have a sales team channel down here as well so this is just the conversation that my team's having with our you know our sales teams having with other members in here as you can see we've got 18 people in this channel right now um and we're able to talk about you know sales tactics strategies you know feedback that kind of stuff and then we have each of our individual teams or our sales team leaders down here you can see that as well and oh we shot a payment success a second ago look at that and so i can click on here oh there we go so you can see literally someone just paid their 2000 payment two seconds ago so that's how easy it is for me to keep track of the payments inside of our company now if we come down here you can kind of get an idea of some of the other ones i'm not going to break down every single channel inside of here but i hope inside of your mind some of this automation some of this stuff is starting to click on some of the valuable things you could be having inside of your company okay the final really important one that i like as well is having a zendesk or some kind of customer success management channel where your your account managers your team manager are able to share with you any kind of issues problems feedback that your customers are giving you so you're able to answer really really quickly uh back to them so they can answer their clients really quickly some of these are the muted channels i had talked about below they're actually from um the like some channels that need to be happening inside of our company but i don't want to be notified every single time they are so this is an example of one of the assets we have it's a three steps to scale course really incredible program it's actually in the description down below and whenever someone opts inside of it it comes inside of this channel and then our team reaches out and checks in hey did you enjoy the course did you get everything okay et cetera et cetera so this is also a great way to check out lead flow inside of your company and i keep it muted because i actually don't need to see it and i don't need that notification coming up every single day and the final part that i just want to show you guys really quickly inside of here is you can add some really cool apps like asana and google drive and zapier all inside of here so that in case you have you know like this is my assistant dropping some information about a you know catamaran that we're going on for new year's eve i can literally comment back inside the task right inside of here i can mark and complete i can like it all of that kind of stuff inside of slack once again my goal is to never leave slack okay and then you can add zoom inside of here as well so let's just go to rovala here if i typed in something all i do i have to do is just type in slash zoom and it because i have the zoom app and it will actually start a zoom id a zoom channel right now that everyone can hop right inside of the channel with it's really really valuable really incredible and i recommend everybody at least get the zoom one if you guys lose zoom because we'll just be chatting back and forth and uh we'll be going back and forth with messages and i'll just like hey let's just hop in a quick conversation slash zoom i hit enter and then boom we have a channel for the whole team to hop in in a few seconds and it kind of builds especially in today's day and age with this remote work it kind of builds that camaraderie it builds that ability for you to have a conversation with someone quote unquote face to face rather than sending messages back and forth and the final thing like i showed you guys earlier and i talked about was this search bar here i just want to show you guys something if i came over to you know one of our newest clients that just joined today and i copy his name and i actually put it up here in the search bar what it's going to allow me to do is see uh you know all the conversations that have been involved with his name in there i can see when he paid when he first joined all of that stuff inside of our search channel here so it's really really important that you're able to have this search features only on the paid plan so that's why i would recommend when you guys get up well it's only the pay plan after you hit 10 000 people so when you get up to or 10 000 people 10 000 messages so when you do get up to ten thousand messages i do recommend you guys uh upgrade so that you're able to search because if we go to my analytics tab here i just wanna show you guys really quickly tools analytics let's just look for laughs here what our analytics look like so 123 public channels and then if i come down here and show the messages and files uh and the last 30 days we've had so just the last 30 days alone we've had 11 000 messages from members um and then if i come up here as well and i just change this to all time you can see some really interesting stats inside of here with active members messages sent uh you know 128 000 messages sent inside of our slack channel so you guys think we use this a lot obviously we do so there you have it everyone the most comprehensive slack guide on the internet i know i talk fast i know that was a lot of information i do recommend you guys go back and watch that again or watch a particular instance again and honestly do it right now don't exit out of the video because it's important to ingrain it in your mind before you forget so go back watch that area again and you'll be

            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: this video was brought to you by skillshare the first thousand people to click the link in the description will get a totally free trial of their premium membership a few days ago one of the largest acquisitions in the history of software companies was announced salesforce the customer relations management company if you want to call it that just got slack for itself for a good 27.7 billion dollars that is more than microsoft paid for linkedin in 2016 it's also more than facebook paid for whatsapp and instagram combined we already made a video about slack's valuation back in july this year when it was already among the fastest growing tech companies ever the valuation or market cap back then was around 20 billion dollars six months later this deal confirms that slack is worth more than 7.7 extra billion dollars now but it all comes with a bunch of new questions who brings what to the table in such a merger is it a win or a loss for slack is it an offensive or defensive move for salesforce in a market where microsoft seems to be the ultimate boss let's talk once again about slack but in this case about the salesforce acquisition of slack in this episode of company forensics let's start with the why that's only a fair question to ask mostly if you go back to august this year when salesforce founder and ceo mark benioff stated that it wasn't a good time for mergers and acquisitions he said that those were not salesforce's plans at the moment four months later he just closed the biggest acquisition in salesforce history almost doubling the previous one and in the midst of a pandemic tableau was the analytics company they acquired for more than 15 billion dollars only one year ago and suppose you go back a little longer also about a year ago slack was getting listed for public trading in the new york stock exchange and its ceo stuart butterfield expressed that he would prefer the company to stay independent in its journey so what has changed in all fairness the year 2020 has changed everything quite a bit that includes the markets consumer habits work dynamics and pretty much everything in between a marriage made in heaven that's what mark benioff has said about the company's merger yes it sounds too romantic but it could also hold true if everything goes right just in case let's do a quick reminder of what salesforce and slack are and why they are thriving in the current times of remote work in short of course salesforce is one of the largest companies in the world it started as a cloud-based crm for customer relationships management which was an operating system mainly for salespeople but now salesforce also powers automated marketing business analytics customer success and back office work this fiscal year salesforce revenue has been reported at 17.1 billion dollars growing 29 year-on-year it has left behind industry pioneers like ibm and oracle under binium's leadership salesforce has been successfully executing a playbook of expansion during the last decade that is mainly by merging several companies that fit into the complete digital business environment salesforce wants to build some of the salesforce acquisitions recently include tableau a business analytics company quip a collaboration tool for documents and files and i don't want to talk about them because they're a competitor and exact target a marketing automation system so you can see what salesforce is doing here they're integrating different business solutions in one place yet slack is meant to be a cherry on top slack is the coolest most effective and transparent way for companies to communicate internally and across departments this is not an ad we actually lost slack and we use it in slight bean who wins and who loses a significant transaction like this one inevitably generates mixed opinions and reactions in the markets the price of sales for stock went down around nine percent shortly after the announcement and it has been zig-zagging its way back up the acquisition caught some of salesforce shareholders off-guard and short-term investors may not be super excited about the move analysts have all different takes on the matter some argue that slack wasn't growing at the pace everyone expected it to grow during the pandemic and it was starting to get left behind by its main competitor microsoft teams so it seems that slack needed a big ally to compete some argue that the prime salesforce paid for slack was too expensive considering that slack hasn't even yet reached a billion dollars in revenue others think that salesforce got for itself one of the most valuable assets in the category of the future of work and the deal will look cheap in a few years from now since the potential is immense some think the two companies have what is needed to build a digital headquarters solution for all businesses but others believe slack's integration into the salesforce environment is not so evident and maybe a distraction from its core business when asked about it beniev remembered a similar first reaction with previous acquisitions that have proved successful over time for example with the exact target merger he has said that the company the marketing company went from making a few hundred million dollars in 2013 to a couple of billion dollars these days it's similar to the tableau acquisition so only time will tell if the slack deal can be deemed a win or a loss there seems to be consent that the merger looks promising for the long term war against microsoft part of the discussion of course about this big deal revolves around slack's main competitor microsoft teams both slack and teams serve a similar purpose and teams is the only other player in this market that can really pose a threat to slack and vice versa but salesforce also competes with microsoft in the tech enterprise market and the team's product was a big gap as salesforce had nothing like it for business communications so in salesforce's roadmap for expansion it seems smart to join forces with teams single largest competitor some even suggest that this acquisition of slack may be some sort of retaliation after the bit war they helped with microsoft for linkedin allegedly salesforce was very interested in buying linkedin and the two made their bet but finally microsoft's 26 billion dollar offer won back in 2016. cnbc analyst arie levy thinks that the nature of the relationship between microsoft and salesforce changed after that now the slack acquisition deepens the competition between these two companies and that could end up being good for consumers the truth is both companies are working towards that digital headquarters concept bring in cloud-based solutions to all the departments inside a company and to all kinds of companies the goal is a new work operating system if you will accessible to everyone anywhere these types of acquisitions are in the end forging how the future of digital work is going to look like and there's much at stake for these two giant companies that want to hoard the market it won't take long to see more significant transformations as digital operations become a new normal for all businesses even after the pandemic this is all happening in parallel with a revolution of digital learning suddenly paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to go to a mid-tier school feels less worth it forcing colleges to reinvent their value proposition

            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: hey guys and welcome to today's video if you're new here welcome if you are returning welcome back in today's video I'm gonna be talking about what a lot of people have been asking I actually got a youtube comment about it as well so I figured I would go ahead and make it in today's video I'm gonna be talking about my client onboarding process and you know once I get a new client what are the first steps that I take so that's gonna be all covered in today's video as well as I'm gonna be explaining slack because slack is a very important part of my communication with my clients so I'm gonna just explain slack how slack works everything that you know that we talk about and slack things like that and show you guys how I have my slack set up as well because slack can be very confusing for most especially one you know it's their first time using slack so I'm gonna go over that and yeah so let's just go ahead and get started with today's video so first and foremost I'm just gonna get inside my laptop screen really quick to show you guys okay now that we are in my screen I want to go ahead and start with the very first steps that I start taking when a new client is being on-boarded into kasaya media which is my agency name okay so the very first step is you know once we get the the go that you know they're ready we've closed the client the very first step is to send the contract via DocuSign now I have pretty much like evergreen type of contract that I send to my clients and I make it known to the clients that this is the same exact contract that I use for every single client you know and never running into any issues with it but of course if they need anything changed just to you know let us know so yeah that's the very first step that I take is to send them the contract and then I also send them the invoice via simple invoices I love that site I'll go ahead and show you so this is what simple invoices looks like they also have like a free trial that you could go ahead and try and this is kind of like what the interface looks like it's really cool super to eat super easy to use so back to the steps okay so now the very first two steps are done right away like I send those emails to them they get both of those notifications in their emails and then their their steps are to look over the contract make sure everything looks good and then go ahead and pay the invoice so those are the very first two steps that are done once those two steps are complete we move on to step three which is to send the welcome email and in the welcome email there is a click funnel link to the rest of the onboarding process so let me go ahead and show you my welcome email so this is the same email that I send to all of my clients in the welcome email this is the first email that I send and like I say right here I send this after the contract has been signed and the invoice has been paid so it's just saying you know hey want to wish you a warm welcome we're so excited to have you onboard ready to take your Facebook Ads over and help skill your business and then I talked about the onboarding process how you have to go through each step thoroughly and completely every single thing that I asked you know make sure that it's done on a laptop or a desktop not on the phone and if they leave you know they they can start again it just won't leave off you know where they finish so they need to do it all in one sitting so just some little notes that I put there for them and then it says click here to get started so once they click this link they are taken to my onboarding which is done through click funnels click funnels is a really cool platform I'm sure you've heard of it if not go ahead and take a look at it pretty cool I'll put all the links to everything that I'm talking down below in the description so you guys can go ahead and check those out so the very first you know funnel and the step is the Welcome funnel so it's step one what to expect from this onboarding process so I talked about you know how the onboarding process is gonna work I don't necessarily talk about how the the relationship is gonna work from this point forward you know within the Facebook Ads part thing it's just talking about how the onboarding is gonna work and what they can expect and then the next funnel is gonna be the process so this is where you know it's a very long video Casey my business partner actually filmed this video and it just explains everything a twosie about what to expect from our 90-day program you know what we expect from the client what the client can expect from us it literally covers everything and I say this to everyone I say this to you know so many people my students you know every one I tell them how important expectations are I you know I've heard some horror stories about people who didn't set expectations right and it was just a mess with the client so I make sure my clients are on page with us and we're on page with them and just everything's going to go smoothly so this is a super long video that we've created and then after that it's gonna be the ads manager integration so getting them you know set up so that way we getting us set up so that way we can take over their Facebook ads yes so that's a short like 10 minute video that Casey filmed as well and then the next funnel is going to be the audience so learning everything about their audience and getting the necessary like marketing assets content and all kinds of things and this is through a Google form that I created so let me pause from this click funnel and actually go ahead and show you my Google form and anyone can make a Google form it's free to use so yeah let me just go ahead and show you that okay so this is the Google form that they get once they click click here so it takes them to the Google form this is the first thing they see so they have to input their company name here so you know I'm just gonna put something really random test next okay so now the the first part is going to be the systems and passwords so we require them to provide dashboard access app access to their Shopify store and again you know just to clarify our agency focuses on e-commerce we work with econ brands who sell a product online so you know the majority of them all have Shopify we don't do local businesses things like that so you know your Google form might be a little bit different than ours okay so now the next thing is you know provide your email system whether it's MailChimp convertkit whatever it is send an invite to us and you know we tell them why we need an email list which you know we usually cover that during the meeting but this is just to reiterate that okay and then the next thing would be to add your business manager ID below and then you know I show them how they can find their business manager what I've learned is that most econ brands know about Facebook Ads you know maybe they've done Facebook ads in the past for their business and they're just looking for someone and take it over or they just have some sort of idea about how Facebook Ads work as opposed to like local businesses where they know nothing about Facebook ads they think like a boosted post is a Facebook ad which you know I could get into that as well but for the sake of the minute video I just wanted to cover this as well so I put a little you know screenshot to show how to find that oh I have to actually go ahead and click this to move forward there we go okay so the next part of this form the intake form is to drop a CSV file of your entire email list here drop a CSV file of your clients only email list here I guess I'm gonna have to go ahead and put some files here and then of course I just have like a little note here of how to do these some people most people won't know how to do this so you might have to create like a little short little loom video or explain to them how to do that and the next step is to provide a Google Drive shared folder with any marketing images to use for ads so we use Google Drive for everything literally you know I'm on Google Drive every single day all day long you know for different reasons but I love Google Drive I love all the Google Apps and general so yeah it's my favorite and we have all of our clients on Google Drive as well keeps things really organized and efficient on our end and you know their end - you know I've had people send Dropbox links and you know things like that on this form and I had then had to have them convert to Google so you know drag-and-drop all those images into a Google Drive folder because I mean there was just so many different links like Dropbox Outlook you know whatever it is we just need everything to be simple all in one place we can't keep going back and forth when it comes to the ads and having you know all the creatives in one spot it works like a charm so make sure to stick with it and also providing their logo any other like guidelines or preferences you know who their competitors are what brands are their inspiration things like that just to have a better idea of the brand so let me go ahead and fill these out real quick so I can show you the next step okay and the next step of this form this intake form is about social media so you know getting their social media links to their Instagram Facebook YouTube website whatever it is just so we can gather more information about the brand and then you know if they have a piece of content that we could watch that would describe their company well some most clients for econ dayson like add that they filmed you know something along the lines of like a brand brand awareness video things like that they would put the link right there so that's important too because this just helps us understand the brand more because we really like to dive deep into the brand especially an econ brand because there's so many out there there's so much competition so it's really important to really understand the brand and what they provide their mission their goals things like that don't see test okay now this section is very important I might have said that about a previous section in this intake form but this is truly super super important it's about their ideal customer when it comes to Facebook Ads you know the most important thing is who you're targeting because you don't want to target some you know someone random who's not even interested in that brand and with that brand sells so you know you don't want to be targeting a some-some mom who's not interested in fitness you want to be targeting people who are interested in Fitness so yeah that's just an example that came off the top of my head so this section is very important and I even stress to the clients that they really need to put a lot of time into this section and like I said this just falls back to the expectations if you set that expectation and you actually tell them hey I need really detailed answers from you I'm on this intake form they're gonna do it I have yet had someone who really just put no time and effort and put like short answers at all so just set those expectations I can't stress it enough how important it is okay so what is your ideal customer look like what do they act like what do they spend their money on you know things like that so I need to know what the ideal customer looks like for your brand and then what is your ideal customer not look like who is someone you know that you don't want to market to put you know put a description about them here and if you look at all of your existing customers who have ever purchased from you what are their most common traits between them what are some patterns that you've noticed so yeah you know like I said a lot of the brands most of the brands they put in a bunch of time into this whole entire Google form and I love it I get like so many long paragraphs of the answers that we can filter through and just read up a bunch about the brand to better understand it and it helps like crazy when it comes to you know executing it and the ads so let me go ahead and fill this out really quick okay in the last section last but not least and definitely very important is communication so during you know during the the meetings previous to onboarding I explained and I stress how important communication is to us we communicate with our clients almost every single day it really depends for marketing usually every single day for management not so much but I mean communication is so important it's crucial and we communicate with our clients directly it's you know us and the client it's not a you know our team member it's us in our client okay so we are super involved when it comes to client communication and I found that being involved with client communication actually built a wonderful partnership you know there's there's times when we are you know talking about just funny things like you know that a revolve around the brand or you know maybe not but it's just it's just really fun our slack channel can get super fun at times so it's awesome to build that communication and that type of rapport with your clients so yeah what I say here is you know all communication is done through slack we will create a dedicated channel between you and us please provide the email addresses where we can send the invitation to so you know if you have multiple people on your team you wish to be involved on our slack channel you can enter their name and email address here so with that being said you know there's there's brands out there who it's just us in the the owner who are communicating in the slack Channel but there are brands out there where we have like a slack channel of 10 plus people where you know we're communicating directly with the owner the brand manager the customer service the contact manager the influencer is like we have everyone in the channel and of course you know we have different channels if it comes to that where we're doing like management and marketing we separate that because there's no sense of talking about Facebook Ads and management channel so yeah I mean it's completely up to the brand like I said some brands it's just you know us and the client talking client meaning the owner some brands it's you know the whole team with that the brand that we take on so it's pretty cool and like I said it can get fun at times you know we can talk about anything and everything and have fun with it but of course you know it's mainly all about the brand what we're working on the goals the plan what we're doing right this moment so I would say about 90 to 95 percent is about you know the services that were providing and then the other like five to ten percent is fun every now and then so yeah and then if they go ahead and submit their their form let me just fill this out all right it's going a little slow our Wi-Fi here sucks and we literally live in this luxury apartment in downtown LA and Wi-Fi scrap but anyway okay so they get taken to this thank you have now completed this intake form please return to the onboarding process to finish those steps so they go back to the click funnel and then they click you know take me to the next step this is the next step it's booking their strategy session so you know I have my a QT scheduler calendar right there on the actual let me see if I can this there we go so I have a quick little video explaining what to do and you know when we're gonna do it so what it's gonna be about things like that so they're gonna go ahead and choose the best day in time that works for them to have you know our client strategy session and this is acuity scheduling which is really really awesome I suggest you take a look at it again I'll put all the links that you know I use down below but yeah you can see right here cutie scheduling that's how you spell it so yeah this is super cool and especially since it's like embedded right here I don't have to take them off to a different tab so yeah that's that's the next step and the very last step in the click funnel is final words so just you know explaining that we're gonna be the time frame to expect after the strategy session when we're gonna have the ads up and running you know that we're super excited to work with them because you know we don't take on any brand so the brains that we do take on we like really genuinely care about that brand we're excited to work with ever in we're not we're not you know people who just take on random clients we have really really intense you know qualifying you know questions and things that we asked long before even coming to this onboarding process so yeah we're just super excited to be working with them and that's kind of what I explained in this video okay now once you know the click funnel onboarding is done the client is basically onboarding at that time so the next step is to get the client set up on slack so I actually created a slack workspace for you guys for this purpose for the purpose of this video so I'm gonna show you guys how I use slack and how to use slack all right here we go okay guys so this is what slack looks like I've created this totally different workspace called mentorship with Mariah I might actually start using this one to keep it separate from my business because you can create different workspaces like this is my actual agency workspace I'm not going to go into it right now of course because like I said it has all of my clients it has you know their information what we're talking about so I'm not going to to that so that's why I created this separate brand new channel from scratch to show you guys and explain to you guys how I use slack and how you can use slack so for example my agency slack right here under channels it literally has like a long bar that I actually have to scroll through to find you know the client Channel so for example well let's just scratch that let me start from the very beginning so you're gonna want to create a slack channel your a slack account I'll put the links down below for you guys to go ahead and sign up it's free they have a free plan they also have a paid plan so it depends on you know how big your agency is and what you're looking to do inside slack then that's when I would suggest getting a paid plan however if you're just starting and you just want to kind of work with slack figure it out put some clients on there maybe you don't have a large client base yet go ahead and get the free plan it works really great I used the free plan for so long so yeah go ahead and get that now once you sign up with slack you're gonna create a workspace name my workspace name for this is mentorship with Mariah so you know make it your your agency name you know whatever that channel is gonna be about make it that name okay so now once you signed up it's gonna pop up to this now the general channel and the random channel are always like automatic and once you bring on a new client into your workspace they automatically are sent and add it to the general channel in the random channel I have it set to where you know nobody communicates in the general channel or the random channel so I actually delete deleted the random channel and you can do that by going to channel settings additional options delete this channel yes permanently permanently delete delete okay so now it's done the general channel unfortunately you cannot delete it it's there slack wants you to have it you can't delete it I've tried so you just have to leave the general channel and then you know as people join some people who aren't familiar with slack they might go ahead and say something in this channel I just delete it if they do it's usually just like hey Mariah or hey Casey whoever it is I just delete it because I don't want anyone communicating in this gender general channel and I don't want anyone getting confused as to what channel to communicate on and especially since like I said that general channel is open to everyone who is in your work space so if a client was to start talking about you know something pertaining specific to them it's not going to make sense to the rest of the people in my work space so just make sure to create a private channel for that client so I'm going to go ahead and show you how to do that alright and then this channel was just created like when you join slack you have to create a channel I'll go ahead and delete that again so once again delete channel yes okay so this is what it should look like once you delete those channels so the very first thing you're gonna do is go ahead and click this plus button create a channel and then make it to private make sure to make it to private super super important like I said if it's not private every single person that you invite to your work space is gonna see this channel and everyone in this channel and everything that you guys are talking about so make sure to make it private okay so there is a bunch of ways that you can do this as far as the name of the channel now again the name of the channel everyone's gonna see this so make sure it's relevant so usually what I do is you know if I have if I'm doing management and marketing for the client then I'll separate it into two different channels so I would say the name of the client so let's the name of the brand so let's just call it say we were working with Nike underscore marketing so that's how I would have it set up if if I'm not doing marketing management if I'm not doing both and I'm just doing one I would just make it like and of course you know it depends how you like to set it up this is how I like to set it up you guys can do it however you want so let's just go ahead and say Nike marketing I never put anything in the purpose you can if you want and then you would want to send an invite to people you can do this here or you can do it another way I'll show you the other way because like I said this is a brand new workspace from scratch so no one's on this workspace yet so let's go ahead and create channel okay now we're in this brand new channel that we created on slack and then up here you can see the member list which it's just me right now there's no one else on this workspace so all right there we go so now to see the workspace directory you can click here click here and then this is gonna be everyone in your workspace directory so you know you're gonna see all your clients right here and then these little green dots mean that they're on and active alright so now that we're in the channel things that you know that we talked about it's everything relating to the brand and the service that we're providing so literally from the point of onboarding till you know continuing the partnership with them all communication is done through slack if they you know and I even say this Casey says this on the onboarding in that long video about expectations if you send us you know an email or you send us a text message or you know you you send us a message on skype or you know whatever it is we're not gonna answer it just gets too complicated when you have clients messaging you on whatsapp telegram email Skype you know all these there's so many different platforms out there so we keep everyone on slack and we make it known that if they don't reply on slack or send their messages on slack you know we're not gonna answer so it's really important to set those expectations I had this one client a long time ago when we first started still working with them and everything's going great but they were new to slack and they really didn't you know catch on so they went ahead and sent Casey a message I forget what it was on maybe like messenger or something like that they sent a message that wasn't on clack Casey didn't respond for like a good hour to and next thing you know the client sent the exact same message on slack they literally just copy and paste into slack and then from that point forward um you know everything has been smoothly everything is on slack and that's the way you know it has to be that's the way we like it to be and you know we set those expectations and everyone is you know usually fine with it we've never had anyone say well I don't like slacker I don't want to use slack so yeah just make sure to set those expectations and you'll be fine okay so if you want to invite someone to your channel of course you can do right here because it's a brand new channel it's a brand new account they're trying to show you how to use it but let's say that's not there and you need to add someone you're gonna go ahead and click the little gear icon again and invite new members to join all right so invite to this channel only I don't create a you know a new channel because I've already created a new channel so continue and then if they're already in your workspace and you created like a separate channel to start a different conversation and a different topic then you can go ahead and take them here and they'll pop up but if they're brand new client brand new to your slack you're gonna want to go ahead and click invite a new person to your workspace type in their email and name right here the name is optional they can type it in when they sign up but you want to send the email address the slack invitation so you're gonna send it to you know the clients email whatever they put on that Google Form put it here they had multiple people add them here and then they automatically will you know send to the channel and start talking there and then like I said all new members will automatically join these channels which is the general channel so if they say in it say anything in the general channel you know go ahead and delete it and then message them in the channel that you guys will be communicating on so as soon as you know the channel was set up and I've invited the team members my next thing that I do is send a slack welcome message to all my clients so let me go ahead and CV there we go so this is the same message I send to all new clients on slack you know hey glad to have you here on slack we will have all communication here from this point forward not sure if you're familiar with slack but I'll send the steps you know below you can take a look at them how to download slack how to set up slack that way you never miss a message because sometimes you know when they come into slack they don't set up their notifications properly so you know I'm sending the messages and they're not getting them so super important that they follow the step-by-step Welcome message pretty much and then I say you know we have you we have the slack app downloaded on both our MacBook and iPhone to ensure we never miss a message if you have any questions just ask if you want to add another person to the team you know moving forward just let us know and then I have the steps to download the slack to MacBook or iPhone and then steps to turn on the notifications from computer and from a phone so this is the first message I send to everyone so I'll go ahead and send this you guys can see and then yeah so now I have my first message here and then there's just a bunch of things you can you know upload a file from your computer there's just so much you can do with slack but I just want to cover the basics because if not I could be here for hours explaining slack but yeah this is the basics of slack this is how I use slack like I said I communicate with all clients from the point of onboarding until you know the whole partnership working with them through slack we communicate about all things you know relevant to the service that we're providing like I said sometimes it gets fun and we talk about you know things off topic but yeah that's how slack works that's how I communicate with clients and this is how you can communicate with clients as well like I said all the links will be down below so you want to go ahead and check these out I highly recommend it because these are like my top favorite apps like I use them every single day I've tried a bunch of apps before and you know just softwares and tools and programs things like that these are my favorite all-time favorite I use them every single day okay and then from that point forward once I've set up on slack basically the client onboarding is done you know I I have stuff to do on my end where I add the new client folder on Google Drive I create a you know a folder with the clients name and then I put everything that we gather from them in that folder we organized it super well very organized keep things efficient or being organized is super super important when you own your own business it's just important in general and then we also create a Trello board workflow for you know myself for my business partners team members things like that we're all on Trello slack and Google these are things that we use every single day so yeah I mean those are the steps to client onboarding super simple once you do it a couple times you get the hang of it it's gonna be like super quick but yeah three steps in the beginning two steps in the middle and then just three steps on my end and then the client is on boarded and you know most of these steps are already like set up in systems and it's super quick and efficient so yeah that is my client onboarding process that is how I communicate with clients and yeah okay guys so that is gonna conclude today's video I hope you guys enjoyed it I hope you guys got a lot of value out of it and maybe just you know comparing my onboarding to your onboarding will help you out maybe you want to tweak some things maybe you want to hop onto different platforms different software's tools things like that that I use that you might not so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed today's video go ahead and leave your comments down below because like I said you

            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: hello everyone and welcome my name is Joe patty and I'm going to facilitate this course for you today we will be talking about slack so what is slack well slack helps colleagues within businesses to communicate with one another not only that but you can also share files and links and even search through older conversations so sit back and relax and let us talk about slack so before we go ahead and download slack we want to make sure that we pick the right one that we need and what do I mean by that well there's different versions of sock available to us based off of what our needs are so let's go ahead and first go to our web browser I'm going to be utilizing Google Chrome and then I'm going to go to slack com once there I'm going to head over to pricing and here we go they have all the different pricing for us and also what it includes with it pretty cool so we have four different types here we have our free standard Plus and enterprise grid so for those of you that are going to get free standard or plus we can do that right away but for enterprise grid just know that you're going to go ahead and get a consultation with slack so that they can best see what your needs are and then you'll go from there for this course we're going to be utilizing the free so I'm gonna go ahead and click on the free version by clicking get started and then it's going to say first enter your email so I'm going to go ahead and click my email I'm going to just use this email right here and click confirm is gonna then go ahead and tell me check your email so I'm gonna go ahead check my email get that six digit confirmation code I'm going to answer my code here and then when we come back we'll talk about creating a workspace all right so what's the name of your company or team so I'm going to use my company for instance which is learn it and I'm going to click on next once there it's going to say what's a project your team is working on so example a quarter for budget maybe a website update so what I'll say is we're working on exactly that will do quarter for budget and I'll click Next the next thing that's gonna ask me is who do you female most about this project now I could go ahead and add a couple people right now but I don't know who I'm gonna add exactly I may include my CEO or maybe I'll include my CEO Oh or maybe my Director of Operations so I really don't know exactly who I'm going to add and that's okay you can go ahead and simply click skip for now once I do that it says tada meet your team's first Channel quarter for budget so now I can go ahead and click on see your channel and slack so it says welcome to slack let's set up your team so I can see here that I'm the first one on the team here and I can go ahead and add by including the name and the email of different people but I'm not going to do that right away then after that you can choose a greeting your teammates will see this when they first get to slack so you can customize this greeting I like this one it says hi team instead of email let's try using slack we'll then go in to start using slack for quarter for budget projects so we can go ahead and well start messaging and talking about quarter for budgets and really get that conversation going after that we're gonna wrap it all up now when I go ahead and click finish setup we're gonna go ahead and talk about configuring that workspace settings setting different permissions and setting team roles so when you're ready go ahead and join me and we'll go ahead and get started welcome back so what I did was I went ahead and clicked finish shut up but before I did that I went ahead and added a couple of people so I showed us how we did that we just entered in the name and the email so I just simply sent an invite to Carly and to Liz and then clicked finish setup once there it brought me to this page and it said you're all set you've assembled your team and started your first project in slack now I know we're pretty excited and we probably want to go ahead and explore but before we do that let's go ahead and talk about configuring workspace settings setting up those permissions and also setting team roles so the first thing I'm going to do is go over to the top of my page here where it says learn it Joe patty and I'm just going to simply click once I do that we're going to go down to are setting administration and then our workspace settings all right so settings and administration workspace settings and it's going to bring us to our settings and permissions so let's talk about some of those settings the first thing I see is joining this workspace we can choose how people join our workspace by accepting an email invitation or they can actually sign up with an email address from an approved domain now I know that everyone that's going to be in this learning workspace is going to actually be from learning so everyone has a approved domain which is blur Netcom so I'm gonna expand this and what i did was i clicked on allow invitations and i did learn it calm so anyone that has a domain learner calm can now simply go ahead and be approved so i'm going to click Save now this is just a preference for me if you did work with a lot of outside companies or organizations you could go ahead and just allow invitations in general instead of going ahead and mining it down to just domains within your company once you're done you could close have workspace' language which just simply chooses a language that is set which is English us right now we have default channels where we can choose the channels new members will automatically be added in - in addition to general now when we go ahead and create a new workspace there's always two channels that will default general and random those always come and although we can go ahead and change the names of those they'll always be there alright so I'm going to go ahead and expand this and I see that right now I can choose that any new member gets included in my quarter for budget Channel and I don't have to worry about general because they're automatically included there if you don't want them to be in a channel you could just simply click X and the new members will just start off in the general channel I'm going to click Save and I can close this we then can go ahead and explain the guidelines that we want our members to follow when it comes to their display names so maybe I want them to only have their first name last name so what I did was I went ahead and I said we have custom guidelines which is first name and last name are required now once again this is preference you don't have to follow exactly what I did we then have named display which can show your members full name instead of their display names we also have email display which can show their email addresses in their slack profile we have do-not-disturb which we can set hours for do not disturb in our workspace where we won't get notifications during that time even if they sent them we can choose if we want to let somebody join or leave and we get a notification about that so I went ahead and I just like to click on show a message when people join or leave just so that I know once again that's a preference we then have hide your workspace URL from external sites logs which I went ahead and I did that's on for default we can also choose how members make calls and slack they can use a third party app or they can use slack itself I always recommend just using psyche itself so I'll say allow video calls and slack and calling option slack and then clues now you do have a setting here where you can go ahead and manage the retention and the deletion rates that's a paid feature so just see that pay plans and see if it is needed for you and it'll just bring us back to that pricing there but you'll know if you would need that or not in the beginning so to get back to my settings I'm just gonna once again go to settings and administration workspace settings and we were all the way at the bottom here also file retention and deletion as well that's a paid feature we then have the option to go ahead and set a workspace icon this is slacks icon by default so we can go ahead and just simply click set workspace icon it's going to bring us there we can choose a file if we have a little picture there and it has some tips on choosing a good icon use a solid background graphical logo or image rather than a text leave some space around your icon and upload an image that is a hundred and thirty-two pixels square or larger perfect we can also talk about workspace name and URL if we wanted to change it right now the URL is learn it space slack comm I love it very simple and we can also delete a slack workspace and make sure it's not done so it says don't delete your workspace if you just want to change your workspace name or URL you might want to export your data before deleting your workspace so this is where we can ultimately delete the workspace if we don't need anything now if we wanted to we also have an option to archive a workspace where it'll go ahead and keep all that data so it's really up to you but as you can see we can export our data and then delete and that's always best practice so let's go ahead and get into permissions real quick as well so setting up permissions these are just different permissions that you give your members or your team to go ahead and modify your slack so as I can see here messages we can set who uses at everyone and our channel those are going to be talked about a little later we also can go ahead and talk about invitations who can invite new people we can talk about channel management who can create archive or remove members we then have to paid features here message editing and deletion another paid feature analytics and so on and so forth so what you can do right now is go ahead and pause the video take a look at some of those settings and permissions catch up with me and when we come back we'll go ahead and talk about logging in to our workspace so we just went ahead and configured our workspace settings right here and also we set our permissions now there's one more thing that we should really focus on before we go ahead and exit out of this we're going to talk about managing members and roles now if you want to go ahead and click on that you'll see that we can manage our members we can also search for current members we can invite people or even filter now you'll see here all the member of the center currently in my workspace that I've invited and you can see here that I'm the primary owner because I created this workspace if I went ahead and I wanted to make Carly an admin or maybe another owner I can actually do that by clicking on this ellipses here and going to change account type and then I can go ahead and choose what account type Carly will have she could be an owner which is almost the same as me she'll have the same privileges that I do except she can't delete the workspace that's the only thing she can't do because well I'm the primary owner I created it now if I wanted to make her an admin that would be if I wanted her to manage or create or delete channels or I could just keep her as just a full member but what you'll notice here we do get this little setting here where it says your workspace is currently on the free version of slack upgrading to our standard plan we'll give you those access to additional user management features so I can't really do anything right now so I'm just going to simply click cancel so go ahead check out some of those features for managing and setting up team roles so now that we set up some of those different settings let's talk about when we're done we're done for the day in slack we're done in our workspace and we want to just simply log out what we're once again gonna go to the learn it near my name click on it and we're gonna go to the bottom here where it says sign out of learning and I'm going to give that a nice click and there you go we're now signed down so what happens if we wanted to log in well I'm going to show you how we do that from scratch the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go to a web browser and we'll go to slack on and we're going to go ahead and click right up here in the right hand corner to sign it and once I do that I'm gonna just enter in my workspace URL which I know is learn it - space and I don't have to type in the rest they have it there for me and I can just click continue once there it's gonna ask me to sign-in since I click save before it actually preloads my email address and password I can just click sign-in and there we go we're back in our work space so go ahead log in log out and when we come back we're going to talk about editing the profile and also setting the status we're going to talk about editing our profile so we want to edit our profile so our colleagues and co-workers know who we are and what we do in the company so it's access that we're going to go over to our right hand corner here and we're going to give this a click once we do that we're going to go to view profile now it's going to put your profile over here on the right and it's going to pin it and we can go ahead and click edit profile once we do that let's fill out some information so my full name it says Joe paddy and it says display name now if you remember in the beginning when we first set up this workspace we went ahead and we required that there'd be a first name and last name requirement so I'm going to go ahead and follow that requirement and put Joe patty the next thing I could do is say what I do for learning which is I'm an instructor there we go I can put my phone number here as well and the time zone I'm in not only that but I could put a face to the name and I can upload an image so I'm going to click upload an image and let's go ahead and find one I think I have one right here let's see if it works all right looks good I may want to crop out Joseph Patti instructor and just have my face here but it's up to you so I'll go ahead and do that I think it should be something like that and there we go I think perfect and I'm going to click Save all right so now I have my image I have all my changes and now I'm gonna go ahead and click Save Changes and there we go everything updated for me when we come back we're gonna also talk about setting our status so go ahead and make the changes update your profile and we'll go ahead and talk about setting the status right when you come back in slack there's two types of statuses we have our active status which is indicated by the green circle here and we have our away status which is indicated by just a circle with no filling now what I want to do is I want to show you how we can set our status so you could set your status right here in our profile or if we did exit out of our profile we can go ahead and click up top by our company and our name and we can click set status you also see that there is a keyboard shortcut for that which is ctrl shift Y I'm gonna go ahead and click set status so when I do that it says what's your status so what we can do here is we can actually type in what our status is and then we can click one of these little icons here to go ahead and indicate what our status truly is so for instance maybe I want to say that my status is working from home now you'll notice that right here if I give this a nice click I can go ahead and use an emoji and I can just search for maybe a house that looks good and when I click it I can go ahead and say working from home with this little house emoji maybe I'm working from home because my son is sick so maybe I can go ahead and type in son and maybe click something like that my little boy working from home due to son being sick and then we can choose if we want to go ahead and clear it today clear within a certain amount of hours or minutes maybe this week or we can choose a specific time and date once we're done we click Save and now everyone could go ahead and see that I'm working from home due to my son being sick now you're gonna notice that I'm still active and that's because I've been actively in slack so the only time that it will go ahead and change to away is if you are not in slack for 30 minutes then I'll choose to send my services away but still it's nice to know that if you click here you'll notice that I'm still working from home so not only can you be active and working from home but you can also be away and working from home or maybe you could be in a meeting and that's why you're inactive so there's different ways to go ahead and see why we're active where we're at or why we are we away maybe we're in a meeting things like that so if you go ahead once again I'm just going to click here clear status will actually clear my status I can then go back and set another status and they have some pre-created ones for you so I might just use this one in a meeting and I might say for only 30 minutes see now even though I'm active once again if somebody emails me they'll see my icon here and they'll say oh I see he's in a meeting that's why he's not answering back and after that 30 minutes most likely they'll see that I'm going to look like Carly here which says away all right so go ahead play around with some of those statuses practice and when we come back we'll have some more fun stuff in slack when we first created our slack workspace what we ended up doing was creating in the beginning an actual channel called quarter for budget but I want to talk a little bit more about channels now so what our channels exactly well channels are topics that we discuss with our co-workers or colleagues so for instance quarter for budget is going to be a topic or Channel that well we talk about different things about the quarter for budget but what happens if we wanted to go ahead and join another channel that maybe somebody else in our workspace has created so as you can see I have Carly and let's and who knows maybe they went ahead and created a channel that I'm not a part of so if you want to go ahead and join a channel let's go ahead and show you how to do that the first thing you're going to do is go to add a channel and once you click on that you're automatically going to be brought to the channel browser here you can go ahead and search for different channels or you could see all the channels within this workspace and look at that it looks like somebody went ahead and created a marketing channel and it says that this is a marketing channel for learning okay well I actually am part of some of learned its marketing so I may want to go ahead and add myself this channel now you're going to only see public channels here so if the channel was marked as a private channel well then we wouldn't see it in this list so since its public I can go ahead and click on it and it's going to pop up the details right here on the right hand side so now I can go ahead and just take a look at the description when it was created who the members are and see what type of shared files there were in this channel I'm gonna go ahead and just simply look at the members and look it's Carly all right so I think that I want to join this channel because this is a marketing channel for learning and like I said before I do a little bit of the marketing so I want to go ahead and click join once I do that look at that it now adds it over here and I am now part of this channel now there's another way you can do that as well if you wanted to go ahead and join a channel you can click on this plus sign right next to the channels and it says add channel once I do that I can browse channels or even create a channel pretty cool so once again to simply join a channel as long as it's public you can go ahead and join it and to do so you would simply go to add channel Browns for it you can even search but you're going to see them all right here click on it and go to add when we come back we'll go ahead and talk about how we can actually create a channel for ourselves just like Carly created the marketing channel we'll go ahead and create one together so take a moment and if you wanted to try this out go ahead and try it out the first thing you want to do before you create a channel is think about the channel well is this going to be a topic that I can really discuss in detail or is this just a general topic that I can go ahead and just discuss in my general channel so as you can see here this is the general channel and it tells me that I created this channel on April 4th and that this is the very beginning of the general channel and the description is is that this is a channel for work space wide communication and announcements and all members are in this channel so we want to think who's going to be a part of this channel what is it going to be about and also do I want to make this channel public or private maybe I only want certain people to have access to it or maybe I want the entire company to be able to add it so let's go ahead and think about that for a second and I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and make a channel for operations because I know that I want operations as a team to go ahead and be able to won't talk about topics that are associated with operational needs so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go over to my plus sign here and I can click on it and click create a channel once I do that it's gonna say what is the name of this channel and I'm gonna go ahead and call it operations once I'm done I can go ahead and put a description and I could simply say this is a channel for the operations team to discuss day to day events cool now the next thing I can do here is I can go ahead and make it a private channel and as you can see it says when a channel is set the private it can only be viewed or joined by invitation so I'm not going to be able to see it if I make it private but if I go ahead and I keep it public anyone can search for list and go ahead and be added to that channel or join it I'm going to go ahead and just leave it public for this example and I'm gonna click create alright it says hey do you want to add all three members of learn it or do you want to add specific people now I know for a fact that liz is part of my operations team but Carly isn't so I may just go ahead and I may just add little etter x' and it pulled her up right here and then I could say automatically add anyone who wants to join learning so this means that if somebody goes ahead and joins our workspace since right now it's only me Carly and Liz if somebody else added into our workspace they would automatically be added to this channel I'm gonna keep that off because I don't want to overwhelm them when they first start I may ask them at a later date hey do you want to join the operations channel but I don't have to do that now so I'm gonna leave that clicked off but once again that's a preference I'm gonna go ahead and click done and there you go we have our channel now once clicked into the channel we have our little description here it says operations you created this channel today and this is the very beginning of the operations channel the description is that this is a channel for operations team to discuss day to day events perfect not only that but I can go ahead and I can actually see all the little activity I did here so I joined operations I set the description and then I added lits now if I wanted to I could go ahead and start typing away different topics or discussions about operations day to day events and that's how you create a channel when we come back we'll talk about how we can actually manage these channels and also different ways to make announcements within our workspace now that we have our operations channel we can do a couple of different things to it so if I go over to my channels section here what we can do is if we go ahead and right-click near the channel which I'm going to right click near operations you'll see we have a couple of options the first option is that I can star the channel now when you start channel what it does is it goes ahead and puts it into a starred section so if I go ahead and click it you'll see that we have starred and operations now this is really great if you're a part of a bunch of channels but you only really communicate in a couple of those channels so for instance I know I'm a part of marketing but I don't talk in marketing a lot and I know I'm part a quarter for budget but I don't really communicate too many things in that I still want to be part of those because I do want to see what conversations taking place from time to time but I know that I communicate often with operations so I'm gonna star operation is just to have it in my start section because it's important to me now another thing we can do if we right-click is we can remove from start if we went ahead and start it we can also mute the channel muting the channel means that you're not going to get notifications within the channel now this can be very important especially if marketing is going ahead and it has too many conversations that are actually giving me too many notifications throughout the day that I don't really meet so if I wanted to I could right-click and just simply mute the channel you'll notice that it is muted but it's not removed from my list you can tell it to mute it because it's a little lighter in color and it's on the bottom so simply unmute you can right-click and just simply unmute it so what else do we have when we right click we can also leave the channel so when we leave a channel we are actually taking out of the channel or not part of it we're not a member of that channel anymore so if you choose that you're not part of operations maybe for me I could just simply leave the channel and when I do that the channel will go ahead and disappear I can rejoin the channel if I went ahead and well clicked on channels when to join and then when to join it again now additional options we can go ahead and copy a link to this channel or even copy the channel name this could be very valuable especially if we wanted to add somebody what happens we had that private channel where we can only do it by invitation only I could copy the link and invite them pretty cool but that's not it there's so much more to managing the channel and I'm gonna show you how we can do so you'll notice that right over here to the right I have my details panel you're probably wondering well Joe how did you get that well how we get our details panel I'm just gonna exit mine is by going to the channel itself so I'm in operations and just simply clicking on details it will then go ahead and pin the details of the operations Channel here we can find out about the channel itself what's up for discussion what's the description who created it and when it was created who the members are shortcuts if there were any hand items if we had any penned and shared files if we shared any files within the operations channel we can also add members we can go ahead and find certain things within this channel we can even call people and start a call about operations but we'll talk about that a little later and we can choose more which is our little ellipses here if I click on more we have a bunch of options notification options muting operations jumping to a specific date within operations this is helpful for when you have a lot of information here and like I said this exact channel is for day-to-day events so you can imagine 365 days well - out the weekends but you never know we can also copy the channel name add apps rename the channel if we had to but then we also have additional options so we're going to talk about that for a second let's give that a click all right so when we click on additional options here are all my options for operations so the first thing I see is that we can archive this channel and it says here if you don't think it will be used anymore and you want to clean up archive it the channel can be unarchive later but every one will be removed so this will help if you don't want to lose any of that conversation and you want to pull it up at a later time but you know you're not using the channel right now you can archive it and then you can unarchive it later but you'll have to re-add every one the next thing is I can change this to a private channel if I wanted to so if you remember when I first went ahead and created operations I made it just a public channel but let's say I did want to make it private to only people within operations I can do so now by clicking on it once I go ahead and do this it says this change can't be undone so please proceed with care so it gives you a little warming and it also tells you things to know so then I can go ahead and click change the private or cancel and you know what I know this is gonna be private so I'm gonna change it to private it once again warns me Joe this can't be undone and I'm gonna say yeah I know and there you go now I know it is a private channel because as you can see here there's this little lock you'll normally see just the number system or a hashtag here but the lock means that it's simply a private channel I'm gonna go ahead and go back to my additional options so now that private channel is removed the next thing in the list would be rename this channel I could go ahead and rename and if I wanted to but I like operations because that's what it's about I can also reset the description of the channel or I can just go ahead and delete the channel but warning if you delete this channel then everything all of the messages everything will be removed and that cannot be undone so if you know that you're gonna need those messages just simply archive it once you're done making these different settings you're gonna go ahead and click on the X it's gonna bring you straight back if you didn't want to have this details pinned anymore click on the X and there you go alright so go ahead try some of those things out and when we get back we'll talk about announcements let's say I wanted to make an announcement to the group well it depends on who I want to notify about this announcement do I want to notify just one person well in that case I would actually use something called a mention to trigger the mention you're gonna do act so when I do ad you'll notice I can go ahead and mention a couple of people here Carly even myself if I wanted to talk to myself and Liz so I can start typing Liz and when I mention her she'll get a specific notification that she was mentioned so this can really help to draw her attention to a conversation but what happens if I want to go ahead and make an announcement to just more than one person what we're then going to use the same thing a mention but we're gonna use three different mentions that work with everyone so the first one is going to be a channel so at channel triggers an alert for channel members even if they are an active in the channel so what I mean by that well if you remember we can take a look at our people right down here and you can see that I'm the only one that's active we can tell because of the green little circle if I went ahead and did at channel Carly and Liz would also get this message because even though they aren't active well I'm using that channel to go ahead and send that notification to people who are active and not active so when they become active they can go ahead and see this what happens if I do something else though let's say I lock myself out of the building and I have my laptop on me and I want to go ahead and say hey somebody unlocked the door for me well if I use that channel even people who are inactive we're gonna get an alert and I'm not gonna want that because they're obviously not active for a reason so we can use something called ah here and here we'll send an alert to everyone in the channel only if they're active so I know that they're active I know that they're actually working and I know they're gonna see my message right away because I want them to see the message right away and come let me in the building so at channel will trigger an alert for members even if they aren't active and that here will only trigger an alert to everyone in the channel that's actually active we also sometimes need to go ahead and make a company-wide announcement maybe not in a specific Channel but for everyone in the workspace so what you would do there is well I said it a couple times you would use at everyone and everyone is going to go ahead and send a notification to everyone within the workspace now this is directly connected to the general channel because if you remember every single member on this workspace will always be in the general channel this is for everyone no matter who you are so that's great so let's go ahead and say that I want to in operations here mention Liz I can do at lids great job on the scheduling I know it's a hard time right now but you're doing great there we go so then that's gonna give a notification to Liz so she's gonna automatically see this which is great now if I wanted to I can also go ahead and send an alert to everyone in the channel so I'll say at channel and it says notify everyone in this channel so if I wanted to I could give that praise to Liz again but this time I want everyone to see it so that they can maybe congratulate her or say good job Liz so I could do at channel and say Liz is doing great shout out to lose there we go and then I can go ahead and everyone in the channel is going to be notified even if they are an active once they become active they'll go ahead and do that and they'll see it if I wanted to send an alert to only the active people which I see there's none but we'll pretend there was maybe in marketing or maybe in quarter for budget I can say I here and I could just simply say maybe give it a click and say hey can one of you please give me a call thanks now I know they're both going to not get this one because well as you can see nobody's active alright so let's go ahead and use the last scenario if I go into general because I know everyone's in general right I can go ahead and use at everyone and it says notify everyone in your workspace so once again this is a full communication to everyone within our workspace and I can just simply say something like the building will be closed until further notice so that's a company-wide thing that I need everyone to know so now everyone whether they're active or not active everybody will go ahead and get that notification all right so I hope you enjoyed the notifications part if you want to try it yourself go ahead stop the video and go try it as I was making those announcements you may have noticed that I was actually writing messages and to write a message is very simple I'm gonna go ahead and move over to my marketing channel and i'm gonna talk about messages so as you can see here this is the message box and to write a message we simply go ahead and type within it but you may notice that we have a couple of tools right down here for formatting let's go over those and then we'll go ahead and take a look at our tools over here as well so the first thing that I notice in my formatting tools is that automatically I see this little lightening bolt this is what's known as shortcuts and if you give it a click you'll notice we have a bunch of different shortcuts the first thing we can do is add shortcuts or even search for them now I have a couple of pre-installed shortcuts that slack actually went ahead and did on that zone so we see here that we have set myself a reminder start a call create a post or even create a code or a tech snippet so you can go ahead and simply add any of these shortcuts if you wanted to look at that we could do a simple pole maybe a gif onedrive access calendar Google Drive Google Calendar but I'll save that for later right next to it we have different formatting tools like B for bold and we also see here the keyboard shortcut is ctrl B now if you've ever used any Microsoft products or any Google products you'll know that when you go ahead and you click ctrl B it bolds whatever text you're trying to format we also have italic and strikethrough if you wanted to go ahead and input something in a code so for instance if I wanted to do some HTML coding I could utilize this a link which we'll talk about in a little bit order lists bulleted lists and also block quotes and then a code block for a larger code so if I wanted to say something like hey how is the project Hey looking and I may just want to go ahead and just simply bold project that I could go ahead and highlight it and click bold or I could have used control bay as you can see here it is now bolded and I can italicize that as well and there you go that just helps it to look more standout ish so that they can see what I'm actually talking about which is project the next thing I can do is I can actually go ahead and I can hide my formatting and if I give that a click you'll notice all my formatting goes away if I click it again it goes ahead and brings a panic I also see down here it says press return or enter to send us but let's say I wanted to go down a second line if I click shift and return I can add another line so for example if I hold shift the center instead of just sending the message I go down it and jump down a second line I also see here that I have my mentions so if I wanted to mention maybe Carly I could do add mention and Carly I can also add an emoji and we have a bunch here maybe I want to do a I don't know how is project a looking maybe looking couldn't find anything maybe search ooh I like that one I just saw let's do look kind of look like glasses there so I might use this as looking I can also go ahead and add an attached file as well to this message once I'm done with my message I can just simply press ENTER and there you go we have now gone ahead and sent a message but what will it look like if I went ahead and I responded to a message well if I actually get a message and I want to respond to it there's a couple ways I can do that now the best practice is to actually respond to a message instead of starting another message so what do I mean by that so let's say I have a message let's see if anyone has sent me anything yet so it looks like Liz wrote just arrived now if I went ahead and I just simply said welcome Liz it would be out of nowhere and she would probably be like okay I sent just arrived yesterday at 10:18 but he wrote welcome is he talking about this comment or something else so instead you may notice that every time I hover over I actually have a couple options over to my right-hand side here let's go ahead and view a couple of those so to get those options you're simply going to hover over once you do that you can go ahead and add a reaction maybe I want to do something like a thumbs up or a big smile and there we go you see here that I click on a grin so I'm happy that she arrived I think can also start a thread which is something that I would want to do because I actually want to reply to this exact message like I said if I put your welcome here well then it would be out of nowhere and nobody would know what I'm talking about but if I go ahead and start a thread I can then see here that the thread pulls over to my right hand side and I can actually respond to this exact post so I'm going to simply say welcome glad you can hang up once again I have all my tools and I could press my send message and it responds directly to this message here and we can see my reply all right to get out of the thread just click close I can also go ahead and share this message if I deemed it very important and I wanted to share it maybe with another team or maybe add another channel I can also save this message if I like and if I click it it's just going to go ahead and add it to my saved items I can also go ahead and click more options to unfollow this thread so I don't get notifications when other people reply I could copy the link to this thread I can mark it as unread if maybe I got to it and I was like oh I didn't really get a chance to read this I can even say hey remind me about this in about an hour I don't have time to read it right now and then now or I will I can also pin to the channel delete or add a message shortcut let's talk about pinning to the channel if I go ahead and I click pin to channel what you'll notice is that it brings back my channel details and now under pinned items I can now see that this item was pinned so it's a quick way for me to go ahead and access it now the cool thing about this is that let's say that I have something that's super important and I want everyone to see it right when they join the team or the channel well when they do that they'll automatically see all the pinned items so they'll be able to see the most important conversations about that channel pretty cool all right to get out of here I'm just going to go to clothes and that's it when we come back after you go ahead and practice of course we'll talk about how we can actually send a direct message to somebody instead of sending it in the channel where everyone can see it maybe I want to talk to Carly or Liz personally one-on-one so stay tuned let's say I want to go ahead and have a one-on-one question with Carly well to do that I would simply have to direct message her so and slack direct messages are messages between two individuals in a workspace so for instance if I wanted to right underneath my channels here what you're gonna notice is that we have a section called direct messages and you'll see that right now I do have Carly here and also Liz now if I wanted to I can go ahead and click on one of their names and go ahead and direct message them right away or I can go here and click the plus sign and search for somebody so for instance if I click the plus sign it's going to say find or start a conversation and it looks like that I already have a conversation going what Liz but I want to go ahead and start one with Carly so I can start typing in Carly's name or I could have just clicked Carly I'm gonna then click go and look at that it says this is the very beginning of your direct message history with Carly Lutz only two of you are in this conversation and no one else can join it which is perfect that's all I wanted so I'm going to say hey Carly can I give you a call tomorrow using slam Thanks so once I'm done I press ENTER and what you're going to notice before I press ENTER is that I still have all those seen formatting tools available to me and it looks pretty much the same as my messaging or posting capabilities within the channels so I'm just going to press Enter and there we go now you may be saying hey Joe I noticed that when you go having me press ENTER you see slack bot what is that well we're actually going to talk about slack bot in the next section so go ahead direct message a friend or a co-worker within your workspace and give them a direct message and tell them they're doing amazing and when we come back we'll go ahead and talk about slack bot so I just messaged Carly and even though she's away I still got a response but it wasn't from her it was from slack bot now you're probably wondering what is slack bot slack BOTS actually a piece of artificial intelligence that's here to help us out so it can respond to things and say hey Carly isn't currently do not disturb mode and may be alerted of this message right away so it's letting me know that I also saw it in my general when I made a response and it says wonder who can read this recent message so it's just there to really help me out now you'll also see slack bot we can actually die rekt message slack bot so if I went ahead and I clicked on slack bot it says hi slack bot here you can ask me simple questions about how slack works or just type a few key words so I can go ahead right now and I could say hello welcome back thanks can you set a reminder and there we go it's searched for set a reminder in the help center and it was able to pick up set a reminder so if I go ahead and I click it now I can actually go ahead and set a reminder and it tells me exactly what to do it says type that slash remind in a message field to create a custom reminder for yourself or other members cool so if I go ahead and I just type in slash remind look at that I can also remind at someone or specific channel what and what and I can set that reminder there pretty cool that it was able to do that it also says working with slack and it has all those little Help Center articles that can help us out so go ahead try it out on your own and when we come back we'll talk about making a slack call so even though I can go ahead and I can post things in my channels here and I can also communicate and text my co-workers or even slack bond wouldn't it be nice if we could go ahead and call them well the cool thing is that we actually can so how do we do that well if I click on Carly again you'll notice that right here in the upper right hand corner is a little telephone icon and if I click it it's gonna say call Carly using slack so I'll give that a click now Carly's most likely not gonna answer I know that she's not working and it may ask you right here to use your microphone I'm just gonna click allow' now you'll notice that my microphone is on and you can tell that I'm talking it's going ahead and testing my levels I can also enable a video if I wanted to and I'm gonna allow that for the first time and it'll turn on my camera which I currently have blocked out so I'll turn it back off but when I don't have it on I'll have my profile picture there you cannot use the share screen it actually needs to be and I'll go ahead and just call again just to show you some of those things there so you do need to upgrade to a paid plan to use the shared screen I can also send a reaction while on the phone and she'll be able to see that I can add other people I can end the call or I could go into some settings and I can name this call I can see my audio settings and video settings as well and set those up once I'm done click away and to end the calm just gonna leave the call and there you go that's a call within slack so go ahead try a call and we'll come back and the next thing we'll talk about is how to share links and actually utilize keyboard shortcuts now there's gonna be times where I want to go ahead and share something with a co-worker or a colleague right so I may want to share a link with somebody maybe I want to share my learn it home page let's say I want to share that with Carly well it's super easy to do that the first thing we're gonna do is we're simply going to click on link or we can use the keyboard shortcut ctrl shift Jim and once I click on it there we go it says add the text and I may want to just simply name this learn it home page I can then go ahead and grab the link or type it in which is wwr Netcom and I can click Save once I go ahead and press Enter Carly will now have access to that link and all she would have to do is just simply click on it and there you go it brings me to my home page so super easy to go ahead and utilize links let's also talk about using keyboard shortcuts so to go ahead and use a keyboard shortcut there's two ways to access the keyboard shortcut menu the first way is for windows control slash so you'll notice right up here once I click control slash it goes ahead and pulls up my keyboard shortcuts for a Mac it's going to just simply be command and slash so if anyone's on Mac out there go ahead and press command + / and you'll see all of the keyboard shortcuts for the Mac now you can see here that I have my basics mine and so on and so forth so if you want to go ahead and take a moment to look through all those maybe use some of them three and when we come back we'll talk about how we can actually go ahead and search our workspace to find people channels files and even messages there's gonna be a time where we may be looking for something whether it's a file or maybe an old conversation or even a person well the good news about slack is that it has an amazing search capability so you'll notice that right up top is our search and I can search through learn its workspace I'm just going to simply exit out of my keyboard shortcuts and I'm going to just go to search and what I notice is is that I can actually search for anything it says searched far and wide but it also tells us that we can go ahead and narrow or search down if we include from or in so let's say I wanted to go ahead and see something from and look at that it says I could search in messages files or more I'm going to search for something from Liz and look at that I can see here that Liz actually sent me a message just arrived so I can see all the messages liz has ever sent me any files she's ever sent me any channels that she's in or any channels that she's invited me to or even just people but Liz didn't really send me any people so it's not applicable here I can also clear the search here and let's say I'm searching for a certain file I know it's in operations but I don't know anything else about it or maybe I don't even know it's in operations I could go ahead and just start typing in the file name and look at that it tells me it's a Word document and tells me what it's called but let's say that I did know where it was and I wanted to narrow the search down I could say in and I can go ahead and type in operations and it says search messages files and more I can see I have four messages within operations channel and look at that I have one file and there it is now you'll notice that we have message files channel and people but next to each and every one of those we actually have something called filter by where we can actually filter to make it easier to find things this is super helpful so let's say maybe I wanted to search for a certain file maybe we had like a hundred thousand files in here and I wanted to go ahead and narrow it down to a document well it's gonna pull up all those documents maybe I want to see who shared it and narrowed it by who shared it or shared in or even the date that it was shared so you can see how the search functionality is just super in-depth and amazing so go ahead take a moment and try it out for yourself and when we come back we'll go ahead and talk about more settings within slack now in the beginning of this whole course we went ahead and shows you how we can set up some of those workspace settings and even set some permissions or even set team roles but now I want to talk about our preferences and what that looks like well first thing I'm going to do is I'll exit out of here and we're gonna go over to our company and our name and give that a click and we're gonna go to preferences once there you're gonna notice that we have a whole section of different things here the first one being notifications the first thing that you're gonna want to do if you haven't already is you may see something that says enable desktop notifications go ahead and simply give that a click that is going to enable the little notifications that pop up in the corner here once you do that you'll have this page that looks like this all right so now take a look at all these different things that we can go ahead and set up now this is all preference for you so everyone's is going to look different everyone's is going to be different depending on what you like or don't like so after I go ahead and put my notification settings or preferences I'm going to go to the sidebar now you're going to notice that sidebar sections are for only paid plans so once you're going to pay plan you can actually organize and group your conversations but until then if you're using that free version that's okay we don't need it we can also show unread conversations all conversations we can show all unread which is messages that have been collected that we've missed in one place lists private channels separately as well so if I click that on it will go ahead and ill list that operation separate than the rest we then can go to themes and choose what looks nicer I like I don't know maybe the dark ah no I'm gonna stick with the light ahead and customize it the different colors here I really like the looks kind of like a bluish but they call it something else that looks good I like the mall I'm gonna pick this one all right we can then go to message media and we can choose to display full name and display names mega man or just a display name which is Meg a bunch of different options here language and region accessibility our mark is read and also some advanced settings as well like different inputs search options and some other ones as well so go ahead take a moment set up your preferences and when we come back we'll go ahead and talk about adding apps within slack and then we'll talk about our desktop app and also the mobile app yes there's more than just this online version of slack which is awesome so take a moment and I'll see you back great so I'm glad that you went ahead and set up your preferences this is gonna be really great for you so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and click on the X and let's talk about adding applications to slack yes slack is amazing in itself but DDP becomes more amazing when we go ahead and add different apps that we come to use and know every day so how do we do that well you'll notice that we went ahead and we talked about our channel section here our direct messages section but we haven't really talked about our app section yet well that's because there's nothing here yet we haven't added anything so let's go ahead and do that to do that we're gonna click on the Plus which is browse apps once we do that we can go ahead and search apps by name or category or we can even look at some of these ones that pulled up right away now look at this we can actually go ahead and add our Google Drive here we can start zoom meetings directly from slack we can even do Google Calendar simple polls look it's endless pretty cool so once you go ahead and find what you want let's say I want to do let's do my Outlook calendar and I click Add it's gonna bring me right here to the app directory it's gonna give me information on the app some settings some of that security and compliance that tells me just some of those details to better understand the security practices once I'm ready to go ahead an ad after reading all this I can go ahead and click Add to slack now once I do that it's gonna go ahead and say outlet counters requesting permission to access the learning slack workspace and I'm gonna say yeah that's great and then it'll give you a little things like well what will your Outlook calendar be able to view and what will Outlook calendar be able to do so if you have those questions you can go ahead and just simply click and see exactly what's going to happen once we go ahead and click allow it's going to actually allow for our calendar and I just have to go ahead and sign in first it says permission requests I'm going to say accept and it's going to take a moment there and there we go and look at that we now have Outlook calendar it says now that you're all set try turning on automatic status updates your status and slack will automatically update based on your calendar when you're in a meeting out of office or working remotely so I could go ahead and turn that on there and there we go so pretty cool I actually have three options here my home which is what's going on today which this is pulled directly from my Outlook calendar I can go ahead and look at messages and even about once again and that's where I'll find those settings as well so pretty cool that we can go ahead and add different applications so I don't know exactly what app set you're gonna be adding but why don't you take a moment and look through some of them and see if you want to actually add them to slack and when we come back we'll go ahead and talk about taking it on the road which is our mobile application or just having a desktop app instead we've been using slack within the web browser but there's more than one way to actually access slack one is through our web browser but another one is to download the app or go ahead and download the mobile app so to download the desktop app we're just going to open a new tab and we're gonna go to slack com slash downloads once there it's going to pick up that we're actually using windows instead of a Mac if you add back it would say slack for Mac once there we can go ahead and just simply click download or we can even get it on the store as you saw and I'll say thanks for downloading slack for Windows it'll have the slack set up right down here and then you'll just follow that setup guide but what happens if you want to go ahead and download the mobile app instead hope to download the mobile app you're gonna go ahead and get on your phone and you're just going to simply go to the Play Store right over here or the Apple store I'm gonna then just search for slack and there we go I would then just simply click install and just sign into my slack and now you have the mobile app the desktop app and also the web browser using all three of them is a great way to stay connected to your co-workers and colleagues so go ahead try that out and when we come back we'll go ahead and say our goodbyes so it's been an amazing journey with everyone and I hope you really enjoyed this course now we know slack really helps colleagues within businesses to communicate with one another right but as you saw there's so much more to slack you can add apps you can go ahead and share files you can direct message people talk about topics that are going on within your company make channels manage channels all this stuff built around helping your business to communicate better with one another so I hope you enjoyed and till next time stay safe

            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: what's up everybody my name is moss norman and in today's video i'm going to show you how to write a python script that posts a message to a slack channel using the slack api in order to follow along this tutorial you'll need a couple of prerequisites first you're going to need python 3 installed on your computer and then you'll also need the request library installed on top of your python installation and lastly you'll need access to a slack workspace and you need to be an administrator of that slack workspace or have permissions to create new apps and enable incoming web hooks now before we get started coding i want to address a question as to why we would want to use the slack api to post a message to a channel and this is actually a very common use case for instance i might use the slack api to automatically post messages as an alerting or monitoring system let's say i have a compute resource where i want to watch the cpu and memory usage and if cpu or memory usage goes above like 80 for instance i want to uh send a message to a dedicated slack channel automatically that's just one example of a use case but there's a whole slew of other use cases that you might want to automatically post messages to slack for in the past i've even used this to monitor the pass rate of uh jenkins build so if a certain percentage of jenkins builds fail over uh a time period let's say like over the last day then i would automatically post a message to a dedicated channel uh you know alerting the team that they need to take a look at why you know all these jenkins builds are failing in the way that i'm about to show you uh how to post messages using the slack api is only one way that you can post messages using the slack api there's actually a couple other ways you could do it there's even a dedicated uh slack api client for python but we won't be using that in this video because we're just doing a very very simple example okay so with that grab a coffee and let's get coding okay so the first thing that i want to show is the slack workspace that we're going to be posting messages to i have the workspace open in my browser and if you look under the channels i have two channels currently i have an alerts channel and then i have a general channel and the channel that we're going to be posting messages to automatically are using the slack api rather is the alerts channel and the first thing i have to do in order to be able to post a message to the uh slack api or using the slack api to that alerts channel is i need to create an app in my workspace that has permissions to post messages via incoming web hooks so from here i'm going to open up this workspace drop down i'm going to navigate to settings and administration i'm going to select manage apps and then from this page i'm going to select build and we're going to create a new app i'm going to call it alerts bot and then i'm going to add it to our workspace and then i'm going to select create app now the next thing that we have to do with our apps configuration is we have to activate incoming web hooks which will allow us to post messages from external sources into slack so i'm going to navigate to the incoming web hooks page and then i'm going to activate incoming web hooks and then when we scroll down here you'll see that there are currently no web hooks that have been added so i'm going to go ahead and add a new web hook to our massimo workspace and from here i get this drop down where i can select the channel that i want to to give this alert spot access to so i'm going to select the alerts channel and click allow perfect and you can see here it actually gives us like a sample curl curl request that we could run from the command line we are going to use uh this url actually not not this specific url but if we wanted to we could actually use this exact command and run it from the from the command line and it would post hello world to uh to our workspace but in our case we want to post to the alerts channel and we want to do it using python so now we're actually going to get to coding i'm going to bring up my python editor i'm using pycharm but you can use any editor that you uh that you'd like and i've already created a file and i've called this python file slack message and what we're going to do is i'm going to set up two functions i'm going to set up a driver function called main and it will accept as input basically a message that we can enter at the command line and whatever that message is is going to be the message that we send to our alerts channel and then we're going to also create a second function called send slack message and that is actually going to take care of the functionality of posting our message and that function is going to use the request library to um to make a request to our the slack api endpoint so the first thing that i'm going to do is i'm going to import the request library then i'm going to import sys and i'm going to import git opt for the the options at the command line that we provide and then i'm going to just add a quick message about what this file does all right and the first function that i'm going to define is the main function so i'm going to go down here i'm going to define a main function that accepts a an argument vector i'm going to define a new variable called message and this is going to be a placeholder variable for the message that is accepted at the command line and if the user doesn't enter a message at the command line when they run this program we're going to give it like a default we're going to set this message to like a default message for when the program is ran so i'm going to go kind of fast through this uh this uh main function and because the point is going to be focused more on the actual senselac message function but now we're going to walk through the options and arguments that are passed into the program at runtime so i'm going to get opt and i'm setting up my available options here the first option is going to be help and then the next option is going to be message so the first option help is just going to print the usage of the program and then the second option will allow the user to provide an argument to that option which will be the message that we want to post to the slack channel and then you know if we get an error we'll catch that error and we're going to print the usage if we get a option error and then i'm going to check if the user if the length of the options provided is zero then what i'm going to do is i'm going to set that means that the user didn't give us a message and i'm going to set the message variable variable to like a default um string basically so i'm gonna set message in this case if options are zero or the length of options is zero i'm gonna set the message to hello world and then uh the this uh for loop we i mean we would typically expect only a single option in this case but i'm still going to use a for loop to iterate over the options and arguments provided and if the option is equal to h for help then what are we going to do we're going to print the usage i'm going to go ahead and just copy and paste that there okay whoops here we go otherwise if the op option is dash m or its dash dash message for the long option then we'll set the message to the argument that the user passed in following that option okay and then finally what i'm going to do is after we've set our message variable and we've pulled the uh you know the text from the argument passed in i'm going to call a function that we haven't created yet called send slack message and we're going to pass into that function the message our message variable okay there's one more thing that we need to set up with the main function if it gets called when the program is invoked so if name equal equals main then we'll call the main function okay okay great so now i'm going to go up and i'm going to actually create a new function and we'll call it send slack message it'll accept as a parameter string a message string so the first thing that i want to do in the send slack message function is i want to define a payload variable and the payload is going to be what we actually send to the slack endpoint and it's going to be json formatted a json formatted string so i'm going to define a payload variable and our payload string is going to be first it's going to define the type of data that we're sending to the endpoint which is text and then the value of that text is going to be the input to our send slack message function so it's going to be a formatted string so mod message and so that that's going to be our payload the next thing that we want to do is we want to actually uh send the request or post this uh payload rather to the slack api endpoint so i'm going to define a new variable called response and that's going to represent the response that we receive from the slack api endpoint and then i'm going to call from the request library the post function and in the post function i'm going to pass in the url which is the slack api endpoint and our payload variable so to get the url let's go back to our slack our slack application the incoming web hooks page and then we're going to copy our webhook url so i'm just going to click copy and then i'm going to bring up the editor again and in quotes i'm going to paste that url into into the function i'm going to add a comma here and then on the next line i'm also going to pass in the payload so data equals payload so this is going to send the payload which is our message of type text to this api endpoint and what we should receive back in the response is an okay or a 200 status code to confirm the the response that we get i'm going to simply print out the response to the console so i'm going to print response.txt out to the console and what it should print out is ok which represents the 200 status code now let's test out our our script by running it in the terminal so if you don't have a terminal in your editor go ahead and pull one up and navigate to the directory where your script lives i'm already in the directory and the name of my script is slackmessage.pi so i'm going to call slackmessage.pi and i'm going to initially um i'm gonna initially uh pass in a message so i'm gonna do the dash m parameter and then in quotes i'm gonna pass in uh my uh my message so i'm just gonna say hello this is moss and then let's go ahead and run that so i got an ok response back now let's check our slack workspace and the alerts channel to see if it actually posted that message and sure enough the alert spot did post that message to the channel let's run it one more time without passing in a message to just make sure that our default argument works so i'm going to run it again without actually using the dash m parameter i get an ok response and if i navigate back to our slack workspace i see the default message is posted so that's pretty much it there's not a lot of code to to posting a message to the slack api if you're using the request library this isn't the only way to post a message as i said before there's even a dedicated python slack api client that you can use but i think the request library if you're just posting a message like this the request library is a very uh simple way of doing it if you're doing more advanced things with the slack api it might be beneficial to actually use the the dedicated uh python slack api client but i hope you enjoyed this tutorial and if you did please consider throwing a like on the video and subscribing to the channel

everyone knows where to go to give their update everyone knows where to go to get caught up that's transformative and now with slack connect we're bringing those same advantages to the work that happens across organizational boundaries slack connect is a foundational set of technologies that enable us to offer our secure communications environment that extends to everyone you work with it allows you to move the conversations you're having with partners with customers with vendors and suppliers with outside creative agencies or law firms auditors consultants to move all those conversations to channels where you get a huge boost to collaboration and productivity we've been piloting this capability for months we just use slack connect to raise a little over eight hundred million dollars in a convertible bond public market offerings are pretty complicated and involve lots of people from different groups bankers lawyers and other advisers and normally you spend a ton of time with all those people in the same room ironing through lots of details so everyone from slack who's working on the deal was in a channel with our bankers lawyers and consultants the senior partners could see what the associations were asking about and everyone knew what questions have been asked and answered we've been working on slack connect for for many years we started by having two organizations being able to collaborate across company boundaries today we're announcing that you can have up to 20 organizations communicating within a channel the goal of slack connect has always been to create the same great experience that end users have become accustomed to and using channels within their organization when using channels across organizations one of the things we've learned over the years at slack is that speed really matters when a user on another team and another organization sends a message you see it instantly if someone else in a third organization reacts to that that's instinct my favorite part of building slack Connect has been the co-creation with customers we started a pilot in last February and so we've been working with our pilot customers actually using slack connect as the way of communicating with them and gathering feedback from them about the product our customers are loving it for the first time they're able to put together consortiums industry groups or associations together in a channel and rather than sending email threads across they can actually collaborate and share information in real time health clinics are teaming up with hospitals and health care providers are working with firms to develop colvett tracing apps venture capital firms are bringing all their portfolio companies together universities are figuring out how they can keep class in session online scheduling meetings even internally is time-consuming externally it's even more time intensive with slack connect in our upcoming calendar integrations we'll be able to scan the calendars of all of the organizations regardless of tools and suggest meeting slots that are available my vision as the CSO at slack is to make slack the most secure collaboration environment for businesses when you think about the things you have to do as a CSO to make your email environment secure you have layers and layers of products that you're adding on to address things like spam and phishing on an ongoing basis if you want a more secure collaboration solution for your organization the first thing you can do is take them out of email and put everyone into slack a lot of our largest customers put enormous effort into security and compliance what ends up happening with external communication is often it goes out of band it goes into text messages it goes to whatsapp and the organization has no visibility and no ability to retain important records black Connect has all of the security features that are currently available to protect your slack channels one of the things that slack has done is to provide our enterprise key management service messages files all of this information is protected by keys that are in the control of the organization if a customer is sharing a channel with another organization and the other organizations people have visibility into data in the that's been provided by your organization and you revoke your keys that data becomes invisible to the members of that organization we've been working on slack connect for at least the last four years and it has been a pretty heavy lift I think it might seem like something that's simple you know we have a channel they have a channel and now you couldn't speak across those boundaries and in some respects it is but that's like we deliver over 65 million messages a second peak times everything from regulatory compliance the data governance to scale has been addressed as we pre architected slack as of now we've got organizations with over 500,000 users sharing channels with other organizations across boundaries to date we've sent over 400 million messages by over a million users and people are running their business today on slack connect what we've seen over the last year as tens of thousands of organizations have begun to share channels across organizational boundaries is the more people use it the faster across the more value is created we've seen companies bring their partners or their customers into slack just so that they could have a shared channel across the organizational boundaries because that way of working together is so much more effective and so much more productive slack Connect is the next big step in achieving our mission and transforming business communication [Music] you\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: hey everyone in this video we're going to integrate Jenkins with slack so that we can send notifications to a slack Channel whenever a build starts succeeds or [Music] fails so the first thing that we need to do is we need to install the slack notifications plugin into our Jenkins installation so we're going to go to manage Jenkins manage plugins go to the tab available and now we can search for slack notification plug-in there you go I'm going to click install and I'm going to say install without a restart so that's it the slack plug-in has been installed into our Jenkins installation and if I now go to manage Jenkins and I go to configure system you will see that there are now two slack sections in our settings page so I'm going to scroll down and here is the first it's called slack web hook settings but this is not the one we're interested in keep scrolling down until you see the global slack Notifier settings here you have to fill in your team subdomain and an integration token now to make this work we need to open up slack and generate a new token for our Jenkins installation so that it can push notifications to our slack channels so let's do that right now I'm going to open up a new Tab and I'm going to go to the slack website and I'm going to open up my own team here now I want Jenkins to push notifications about my builds to a separate channel on slack so I'm going to create that Channel first I'm going to say create channel and I'm going to call this channel builds and I'm going to give it a purpose Jenkins notifications for our builds there we go and I'm going to hit create channel so right now we have our channel the next thing that we need to do is we need to give Jenkins permissions to push new notifications to this channel so to do this we're going to go to this wrench icon here and we're going to say add an app or integration this will open up the slack app directory where we can install a lot of custom Integrations we're interested in the integration for Jenkins so we're going to search for it going to search for Jenkins and there you have it Jenkin CI we're going to click on this and we're going to say add configuration now what we want to do is we want to give our Jenkins the rights to just one specific Channel and here we can pick to which channel we want to give Jenkins access so I'm going to say the builds Channel and I'm going to click on ADD Jenkin CI integration now slack just notified us that the integration has been added and now they also give us some setup instructions now I'm going to show you how to add these things but just scroll down till you see step three and here you will see the team domain and the integration token this is what we need to configure the plug-in so here I'm going to copy my team domain and I'm going to go back to Jenkins and I'll paste the team domain name in team subdomain now I'm going to go back to slack and I'm also going to copy the integration token that they've generated for me and paste in the integration token field now as you can see the plugin warns us it says that if you put your integration token in this field it is a potential security risk and that you should use a credential ID instead now you can pick whichever one you like both ways will work perfectly but I'm going to go for the more secure option and show you how that is done so I'm going to cut my token here and I'm going to say add credentials we're going to add credentials to the main Jenkins group and we're going to go to kind we're going to select a secret text and we're going to paste our token into the secrets field there we go we're also going to give it an idea we're going to say Jenkins slack integration and we're going to say token to push notifications to slack we're going to give that as a description we're going to click add and now we're going to pick that token and now the last thing that we need to do is we have to Define to which channel that Jenkins should push notifications so I'm going to say Jenkin should push it to the builds channel so now that it's done we can test our connection to slack there we go it now says success we can save the configuration and now we can start sending notifications from Jenkins to our slack channel so let's now use this into ation let's open up the my website project and let's configure it now to configure the slack notifications scroll down to the bottom until you see the section post buil actions and here you can add the slack notification action once you do that you can choose which notifications to push to your slack channel so in this case I want to notify my slack Channel whenever the build starts whenever there's a failure and let's say also Whenever there is a success and that's it I'm going to hit save and I'm going to trigger a new build and see if the integration works okay so our build has just finished let's go to the slack Channel let's say that we got it and there we go the plugin has sent three messages to our slack channel the first one was to test its connection then the second one was to notify us that a build was started for the my website project and shortly thereafter we've got a success message to say that our my website project has successfully been built in 2.5 seconds so that's it for this video If you find this interesting make sure to check out the rest of my Jenkins tutorials if you like this video subscribe to my Channel or visit my website and as always thank you very much for watching\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: [Music] hello everybody and welcome back to part three of the slack bot tutorial so in this video we're gonna be going over commands this one will be a little bit shorter than the previous one i apologize that one was about 20 minutes long but i did need to cover everything and this will show us how we can use like slash commands inside of slack and send that to a specific endpoint on our server that can handle that and do something with it now i want to make it very clear that commands are different than events so if we look actually at the slack api here or if we even just look at our slack thing right whenever we do something in the channel that's kind of an event right like if i react to this message so say i go here and i you know add a reaction or maybe i even edit this message right so maybe i mark it as unread or i pin it to the channel or edit it then is that is an example of an event now a command is something like this right if i go slash slash message or slash me or whatever these are commands so how can we add specific commands custom commands to our bot well what we can actually do is we can go here we can go to slash commands and we can create a new command now it's actually pretty straightforward what we do is we add the command that we want so in this case the first command that i'm going to show us is how we can get the amount of messages that a user has sent so i'm going to say message hyphen count is going to be this command now it's asking me for a request url the request url is what we're going to send the command to or send this event to whatever you want to call it when this command is called so this needs to be the same thing that we used for our events so if we look at our forwarding we see that we have this address right here so we're going to add that as the base of our url so we're going to put that like that and then we need to make some endpoint on our server that can handle this specific request so if i go back to my app here what i need to do is make a new route or make a new endpoint whatever you want to call it an endpoint is just like you know slash home or slash back or slash login those are all examples of endpoints that we can hit with this request so i'm going to say at app.root and this is the basic way that we add a new route or we add a new endpoint to our server so at app.root and i'm going to say slash and in this case what am i going to call it message hyphen count all right so there we go we're going to add that endpoint and we're going to say define message underscore account like that and then inside of here we're going to return a response and then 200. now i'll explain what this is in a second but go up to the top of our program and from flask what we need to do is we need to import request and we need to import response with a capital so if we go down here now what we're doing is returning response 200 all this is saying is okay i think we actually need brackets here my apologies we're going to return some empty response whenever we hit this endpoint and we're going to return the status code 200 which simply stands for okay now you may be familiar with the status code 404 you know endpoint not found or url not found this is just saying hey we're just going to tell whatever hits this that yep we're all good even though we haven't even really done anything inside of this function right so let's get out of this for one second and let's go back to the thing right here and now what we're going to do is add the endpoint message hyphen count so we're going to add that base url right which is what we use for the events and our callback and all that stuff and then we're going to say slash message hyphen count we can add a short description in this case returns your current message count you can tell i've already prepared doing this before and what i will do is simply save this all right so you've changed the permission scope of your app please reinstall your app okay great so we got to do that let's go reinstall press allow and now we are good all right so if we go back now to our ngrok thing we should actually won't see any because it hasn't hit yet but essentially we need to run this server so let's rerun this and now if we hit uh this slash message count you know endpoint something will happen so let's go back to slack and let's go slash message hyphen count let's hit that and we failed with error dispatch failed so something happened here inside of message count let's actually have a look here it says 405 method not allowed so what does that mean well what happened here is we sent what's known as a post request to this route now by default when we set up a root in flask it only accepts the method of get so there's all these different http methods right we have post we have get we have put we have delete what we need to do here is simply define that we are allowed to send a post request so i'm going to say methods inside of here and all capitals inside of a list i'm going to put post now let's say that we wanted to potentially receive a get and a post request well we would simply do get comma post right pretty straightforward in our case we only want post and post the reason we have that is because we're just going to be looking for some data to be posted to this endpoint so now that i added this if i rerun the server and we go back to ngrok or sorry we go back to slack my bad we resend this we should actually be good so we have a look here we can see in our flask console we actually got the post request to slash message count if we go to ngrok we can see that 200 okay happened when we sent the post request to message count so now the question is how do we actually do something with this command right you know i want to keep track of all the messages that a user sent and then tell them how many that they've sent back well there's a few different steps here it doesn't really matter what order we do these in but first i will show you how we can get information about the user from this route right because we no longer have a payload like we had previously let me go back to full screen so i can't really do the same thing i did before where i print out the payload and then i get the event and all of that i can't do that i don't have a payload so what i actually need to do is i need to get the information from the post request form is what it's called so it's kind of like the data that was sent with the post request it wasn't sent as a payload it was sent in a different way so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to say okay data in lowercase equals request dot in this case form now form is going to give me a dictionary of all of the key value pairs that were sent here so let me just print out data and show you what it looks like so print data and now let's go back to slack and let's type hi like that oops what am i saying hi slash message count let's run that the command happened and well it would be helpful if our server was running so am i bad about that go back to slack again slash message count and now you can see that we print out all of this stuff so if we have a look here we get an immutable multi-dictionary you don't have to know what that means but that's just the data type that essentially we're getting when we look at the form and we can see we have a token we have a team id domain channel id channel name user id and all of this other information right so the username is tech with tim this was the command this was the text because we could technically do something like slash message count and then add you know some arguments afterwards we're not doing that in this situation but we could do that if we wanted to so what we need to do now is get the user id from this immutable dictionary so we're going to do is we're going to say all right user or user underscore id equals data dot get and then inside of here what are we going to type well you guessed it user id now of course we also can check to make sure this wasn't the bot but we know the bot's not really going to be doing a command right so that's not something we need to be worried about and then we can return to them the amount of messages that they have so in this case let's just actually print something to the screen or let's send a message back into that channel and just tell them some random thing for now just to make sure this is working and then we'll actually make it send them the amount of messages so we actually want the channel id as well so let's grab the channel id while we're at it we'll say channel underscore id equals data dot get channel underscore id and then for the text let's send back i got the command all right so running let's go back to slack and let's see slash message count and i got the command gets returned to us awesome so that indeed is working so now we need a way to actually track how many messages that they've sent so this is pretty straightforward we could do this in a database but i'm not going to be worrying about the database right now we might do that later on in the series i'm just going to make a dictionary here and i'm just going to say message underscore counts equals this what we're going to store inside of this dictionary is keys that are equal to the user id and values that are equal to the number of messages that they've sent so i'm going to say user id colon and then whatever the number of messages is now to do this is pretty straightforward we're going to go inside of the message function here and same thing here if the bot is not here so if it's not the bot then what we will do is we'll say okay if user id in message counts then what we'll do is we will say message counts user id plus equals 1. the reason i'm doing this is because i'm essentially saying is all right if we've already added this user id into our message counts dictionary and notice that it starts off blank then all we have to do is increment the value that's stored for this key right we just need to increment that number otherwise what we need to do is say message counts user id equals one because if this is the first time that we are like keeping track of this user maybe it's the first time they sent a message we need to add them into this dictionary and then we'll just default or instantiate their value to one because this is the first message that they sent so hopefully that makes sense but this will simply add up all of the messages we'll add in users if they're not already in there and if they're already in there we'll simply increment the value now keep in mind this is going to be stored in memory right so in ram so if we ever stop this server and re-run it then this value is going to reset so obviously this would make sense to put in a database but that's a little bit beyond the scope of this tutorial so maybe we'll handle that later on but anyways what we can do now is go back to message counts and now rather than just returning text we can simply return that user's number of messages so the first thing that we're going to check is we're going to make sure that the user id is inside of the message counts right so we can do this in a few different ways but actually what i'll do is i'll say message underscore count equals and then message underscore counts dot get and we'll do user underscore id comma 0. now what this is saying is okay let's look inside of the message count's dictionary trying to find the user id if we don't find that and only if we don't find that return 0. if we do find that return the value that was stored for our user id hopefully that makes sense and then for the text we can say messages colon and i'm actually going to use an f string again you need to be using python 3.6 or above for this to work we'll say message and then inside of here message underscore cat what this will do is simply just replace inside of the string whatever number this this value is equal to hopefully that makes sense but we'll run this and you guys will see in a second so let's run this and let's go to slack and let's just type a bunch of messages and just do a bunch of gibberish and oh i forgot that it was going to return to us all of those messages that's funny but let's go slash message count and let's run this and it says we have five messages now let's send another message okay and let's go slash message count and how many do we have now we have six and we'll send two more and then slash message count and we get eight right so it makes sense that is how the command works now i actually think i'm going to leave the video there i will quickly just remove the fact that we're sending this post message i actually don't want to do that the reason i set up this message event previously was so that we could kind of transition into this keeping track of how many messages were sent but with that being said that has been this tutorial so if you guys enjoyed make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and again i will see you in another slack bot [Music] tutorial\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: I'm going to talk about a little bit of some of the transitions that slocks gone through over the last couple years just by the way of introduction this was the nice welcome post that my manager julia posted on my first day at slack just about two years ago um when I joined the infrastructure and scalability team before this I spent a bunch of time doing various startups and other companies mostly in the networking space and spent some years at Berkeley doing a PhD that's got very little to do with anything I'm going to talk to you about right now um and this is not a talk about a transition from monolith to micro services so there were some really really great talks that happened earlier about this theme and so I encourage you all to if you didn't see it catch the video afterwards what this is a talk about is really the focusing on what's changed in slack in these past couple years so to start kind of framing the conversation we'll go back in time a little bit I'll lay out the basic architecture of the slack service in 2016 motivate a little bit of why we made these changes in light of new requirements and new kind of scaling challenges talk most of the talk will be about what we did about it and then I'll kind of thump some up with some themes that came out of that work and talk a little bit about what we have in front of us all right so it's all getting a time machine and go back to 2016 I've just joined this company I'm really excited to start and I go through this presentation about how slack works at the time I'm not going to do the thing where I ask everyone to raise your hand if you use slack but if you don't know slack it is a messaging communication hub for teams people can communicate in real-time with rich messaging features in order to get their work done there's lots of integrations there's plenty of other features in the product and I just want to point out right now I'm mostly going to be pretty much actually all gonna be focused on the core messaging features of the product search calls there's all these other parts of the system that I'm just not going to talk about that have their own interesting tails to them because this is just about the messaging core of the application so it's important to note that slack has organized around this concept of a workspace when users log into the service you log into a particular domaine that relates to your company or an interest group and then all the communication all the user profiles all the interactions really live within this kind of bubble that we call a slack work space and this is a really important element of the architecture at the time so then back in 2016 with about four million daily active users people stayed connected to this service for much of the work day there's a large number of our users would come in open their laptop in the morning and have stock open for the for really the duration of the day before shutting down at night and so our peak connected users there's kind of globally were about two and a half million at peak at that time and those sessions are really long ten hours a day where people would stay connected to the service at the time we had organizations of around 10,000 plus users were kind of the biggest that we're using the product at at that time and really there was this culture of a very pragmatic and conservative engineering style and you'll see that and kind of reflected in the architecture of how this system worked which really can be drawn up in five really simple boxes on this diagram here client applications made lots of their interactions with a big PHP monolith that was hosted in Amazon's u.s. East data center in fact most of the site ran out of Us East it still does actually backed by a my sequel database tier there's an asynchronous job queue system which has had its own share of scalability and performance challenges but I'm actually not going to talk much about that during this talk but really that was where we would defer activities like unfurling links or indexing messages for search would kind of get pushed out to that tier and then in the yellowish boxes on the top was the real-time message stock so in addition to having a pretty traditional web app with all the letters of lamp in there Linux Apache my sequel end PHP all present and happy we had this real-time message bus that was custom software built in a Java tier that is where all of the kind of pub/sub distribution of the messaging product happened the only thing that didn't run in u.s. East one was this thing we called the message proxy at the time it was really just responsible for kind of edge terminating SSL in proxying that WebSocket connection over the WAM back to us east there's a pretty simple model right five boxes to describe all of slack and that was kind of reflected in a little bit of how the client and server interactions worked so you stand up the client you open it in the morning and the first thing it does is make this API call RTM dot start to the PHP back end which would download the entire of the entirety of the user model sorry the entire workspace model so every user all of their preferences their profiles and pavatt ours every channel all the information about them who is in every channel all of that would get kind of dumped to the client and the client would populate a pretty that model and vision of the metadata of the team and then as part of that initial payload we also got a URL which the client would then use to connect to a WebSocket to the nearby message proxy that would then go back to the message server and so once you're connected to the service you're using it for ten hours a day um pushes would come over that WebSocket you know messages would arrive a user might change their avatar and you'd see the the image show up and immediately update and so all of the both a data plane and control plane messages were kind of sent over this real-time message service to keep the client up-to-date though the backend was scaled out horizontally by some pretty straightforward charting approach where when we create a new customer a new workspace in slack we assign that workspace to a particular database shard and to a particular message server shard that was pretty much it right you log in the first API action you would do would look up the metadata row from this database tier that we call domains the kind of key initial bootstrapping tier that response would go back to the PHP tier and then it would know which of the database shards and which of the MS ARDS to route this request to and then from that point on pretty much all interactions for that user or actually for all of the users in that workspace would be confined to that one data shard and that one Msgr now at the time we kind of managed our servers in this mean that I'm sort of calling a herd of pets people have heard this cattle verse pets metaphor we really had a lot of these individual pets each database server was kind of and message server was known by a number and lots of manual operations were needed to keep that service - you're up to date um the PHP code the kind of monolith would have a big mapping that would say database shard number 35 here is the host name that that is currently running on and they were kind of like I said manual processes to keep that up to date the one exception of that is that we ran our databases in this slightly non-standard way where we had to my sequel hosts running as active active master master replication between them meaning each side was available for rights and they would replicate across them which is a particular design choice that the real reason we did this we were not dummies we did this as a as a pretty pragmatic approach to get a site availability with the obvious caveat that we would sacrifice some consistency so every workspace in addition to having one particular numbered pair of my sequel hosts also had a preferred side that it would try to read and write to and so when everything was up and functioning every team every workspace would be pinned to one database host with the other side is really just the backup for replication if anything goes bad though the application would automatically failover to the other side and yes that did produce some conflict problems and there were some challenges along the way but for the most part this model basically worked and the site was able to scale accordingly and really there's kind of two dimensions for why I think this really worked well for slack in 2016 the first is that overall client model really enabled a very rich real-time feel to the product that I think was a huge part of why slack was so successful um it really just felt like everything happened right away after users did it messages appeared reactions appeared it really was a key element of that kind of making the feel of the messaging product that kind of rich experience even when it came to all of these metadata updates and then for the backend we didn't have a huge engineering team and five boxes is a pretty simple model to keep in your head about how things worked and if a particular customer was having a bad day you could figure out very quickly you know which was the database host I needed to go look at what was the MS message server host that might be on fire you know that kind of debugging and troubleshooting was you only had three places to look at for what the problem would be and so that really helped the team focus on building the product and building the user experience that I think was such a key part of why slack was so successful cool but this is not 2016 this is now 2018 and in the years between them there were some challenges that we ran into which is why that model kind of no longer worked very well for us there's really two dimensions this one was the increase in in scale for the site increase in usage and then some pretty fundamental changes in the product model it's a first scale as you see here we had great growth that growth has continued to the point that in 2018 we now have more than eight million daily active users for the product more than seven million of which are connected at any one time this is a peak right off the presses light lean yeah anyway so that's a lot of people connected to the service and we're hosting organizations of more than 125 thousand users so we've doubled our user base and we've more than 10 times increase the size of the largest organizations that are using slack and as a result of kind of many of these scaling challenges as I'll note more in this talk we've adapted our engineering style we're a bigger team we're a little more ambitious in the types of solutions that were willing to embrace when it comes to complexity in service of some of these big challenges now the product model I mentioned before where there was this nice tidy workspace bucketing for all of the interactions in slack that also started to break down and this was really two phases the first was the introduction of the enterprise product of slack I'm not sure how many people are aware of this but for large organizations we offer a version of slack in which you can actually have separate slack workspaces for each subdivision or a geolocation or other organizational unit within a larger enterprise so that local teams can have their control over their channels and their preferences and which integrations are added to it but these are all part of an umbrella organization and so you know Wayne Enterprises can have announcements global channels where the CEO can disappear okay right now my message is that everybody in the company can see but then you know Wayne security has their own control over their future but this means that each of those kind of workspaces has its own notion in the backend has its own database showerheads its own and uh shards and so any Khanum user now no longer belongs to just one nice organizational bucket at the back end we now have these different contexts to consider is this an organization-wide channel or is this a local channel and then things get even more interesting with this feature called shared channels that's currently in beta where you can have two completely separate organizational entities with their own management under billing and they can create a shared channel between them for collaboration this is really heavily used by for example design agencies or PR agencies that want to have relationships with multiple customers where those customers are also using slack and they can communicate within their home spot I've talked to people in the other company well this really fundamentally blew up a lot of the assumptions that that original architecture was written kind of written to service because now channels no longer belong necessarily to one workspace but they're not sharing cases in which you Center how do I do that architectural model to go take into account the bigger scale and some of these new shifts in the landscape so like I said that prosperous nation Channel was one challenge and then just dealing with the scale you know we had all the great war stories that we have eluded to where you know an action would have been across a large number of customers for one workspace and all the client applications would come back and then thunder into the back end to hammer it for some data but as we got to bigger and bigger organizations that boot payloads and I mentioned before got bigger and bigger so we started to have challenges of just getting clients connected to the site and then this heard of cuts you know it works fine when you have 20 servers it starts to get bad when you have a hundred if you're getting into hundreds and hundreds of servers just the manual toil that was taking to keep the site up was just creating on our service engineering operations teams alright so now let's turn into a little bit of what we did about it and really I'm going to talk about three kind of separate changes to the service that were really in service of a number of these challenges the first topic we'll talk about is a change to the client-server model enabled by a cache of a service called flannel that allowing us to really slim down that initial newspaper until we take a little step back I did some spelunking in our data warehouse the original artyom start payload was a function of the number of users in the team with the workspace times how big their profile was how many channels there are how big the topic and purpose the channel is and then how many people are in that channel times the size of the user ID and I just pick three random teams three rows or workplaces with different numbers of users and you see you know every 1000 this is a you know reasonable 7 megabyte Kalyan not great as you start to get up to you know tens of thousands or 170,000 users the payload gets to be enormous gets to be you know basically prohibitively expensive for every laptop or iPhone to pull that full payload down whenever a user wants to get onto the site and let's remember that that's per user so if I have a hundred thousand users each pulling down 100 you know 100 plus megabytes of data that's just gonna handle this and so the biggest change we did to address that was the name not the initial payload to be much much smaller we did that by an introducing an edge caching service that we call flannel that's deployed throughout winter presents all over the globe close to clients and then we change the WebSocket connection flow so that after making an initial thin connection to the PHP application we then connect the WebSocket to a nearby flannel cache oxys the connection to the message proxy and then to that root pub set that's it sir so as I mentioned flannels a globally distributed education when clients connect there's a routing tier in each edge pop that routes a client team with workspace infinity to a flannel cache that is likely to have the model for that workspace we didn't want to get in the situation which flannel had to have all the metadata about every customer it's like does that really not scale so so you find next level that's nearby that has the model for your work this then because it's a proxy for that socket connection it's actually in mind and able to man in the middle the updates that occur for the users in that in that workspace until that allows us to take all of those user profiles all of that channel information how does the initial group end so the things that we're making that the payload huge we just remove them altogether and then expose the callback query API so the clients could with very low latency fetch unknown information from a nearby planet so that allowed us to maintain that really real time and feel to the product where every bit of information you see on the screen actually shows up at medially and it feels like it's instantly there but without having to download all of it to the client to be kind of pre-staged there we allow this kind of really rapid query response to the API to an educated Flamel very close to the users that was able to service those craters and this was hugely successful in allowing us to scale the product to be the larger and larger organizations one thing back in here when we were rolling out planula this was both and operations both are kind of back-end server refactor and then a huge client the clients had expected you know they're written from mainland to expect that the whole model was resident memory and so if you think about taking a you know large JavaScript to our other kind of Swift and the Android code base and now they have to be prepared to make callbacks if an object doesn't exist and so we did this in phases you know it obviously took cooperation and huge uplift from the client teams and the final teams today little an interesting approach we took as part of the initial rollout was because flannel staff has a man in the middle between the back end and the front end and it had this in memory models of all the users it actually have a mode initially where even sniffs the WebSocket messages that were coming across the wire to a different client and if it's saw a user ID or a channel ad than it thought the claims you can have it would just inject that metadata in line to that WebSocket stream so it's kind of ready in the model right before the client component while we went through this long slog of rewriting the clients to expect projects to not necessarily exist the Omegas callback api but with these kind of techniques and place and the kind of long hard work of all the engineers we're able to build this flannel based metadata model that really really really enabled the site to scale to these larger larger and larger customers in organizations the next big change we made is to the native this layer from the WebSocket sack to the back end and this was a really big fundamental rethinking of how we wanted to do our day to day sharks and this is stemming mostly from the challenges that we had from continued database hotspots due to the co-locating all of the users and all the channels for an organization onto a single database shower so I just pulled out some of the kind of redacted post-mortem titles from our github repository where you know charge and he's overwhelmed with queries or new features would get rolled out and they would be kind of you know not always blue test they could and so the load would come in and it would just hammered these data big sharks the graph on the left is actually the top hundred databases in terms of daily query time that I just pulled from a random thing back in history and you see the kind of top you know on that particular day one chart is more than five to ten you know five to ten times as busy because all arrested and this would just keep happening someone would do something on a if I'm an organization that we didn't expect maybe provisional whole bunch of movies occurs or delete a bunch of channels with these kind of unexpected sort of feedback which would occur where all the clients would react to that and send all this live to the back end that would just overwhelm our servers and so we knew we needed to do something about this and the observation did at the time was that this workspace scoping was really useful to kind of keep things nice and tidy when you had lots of small organizations using slack because the load would gets spread out and as we started to get bigger and bigger single organizations not started to be a challenge because we were funneling all of the activity from all these users on all these channels down to this one minute a shark that's what we wanted to do was change our charting approach so that you can shard by much more fine-grained objects and accusers were channels and so we'd be able to spread that load out more efficiently to our big data base fleet of that guidance so in order to do that we introduced a new data steer and didymus technology to our system that's called the test so the test is rolled out as of a second sort of fully featured data pipeline for the application to use and the test the way it works is that it is it runs my sequel at the court and so it is a sharding and topology management solution that sits on top of my single in the test the application connects to a routing tier called VTA the TK knows the set of tables that are in the configuration it knows which set the back of the servers are hosting those tables and it knows which column a given table is charted that until that allowed us to configure the system such that user scoped tables would be started by the user id channel stroke tables can be charted by a channel ID workspace go to my workspace ID and all of that knowledge is no longer in our PHP code that knowledge is not outsourced to the application and from the PHP code standpoint they look at you know they query et-gay using the bicycle protocol as if there's one giant database that has all the tables and that the ADA is responsible for disseminating and doing all of their routing where necessary it can scatter and gather requests for multiple charts if a given query doesn't necessarily fit it doesn't necessarily get routed to one chart and so that allowed us to efficiently and effectively rule out policy we wanted where data tables would be spread and the multiple servers based on the particulars of that table without needing to do a bunch of application now along the way it has also improved a lot the consistency story and our topology manager so that idea of the active active master master mr. LaBelle no longer applies here in the test we have a single regular master and we rely on Orchestrator open source project on github to man into the family I meant to mention the start the test was originally invented at YouTube as their approach to sharding by sequels and scaling that back-end and we've taken that open source project and adapted it for slack's use now with the tested place weren't able to really effectively scale that data tier and so we now get to the sort of best of both worlds where we are still using my sequel which we have a lot of know-how and a lot of confidence in but we've outsourced that topology management into the test system and the sharding decision and how data is allocated in also into the chest which enabled us to make these transitions and thereby eliminating a lot of the hotspots that we have in our databases now one caveat about this that I want to mention is that the migration from our existing system to the test it's been a little bit slower than I'm gonna play actually become in many ways this is somewhat fundamental because we're changing not only how they did the stored but the particulars of how an application wants to use that data we've just run into the need to kind of go very slowly and carefully to maintain the site and so although we are underway and the testing stuff proven it has everything solid database platform to build upon I think many of us had hoped that this channel sharding project by the government faster we're making good progress I have high confidence to succeed which is actually the project I've been meeting the most of slack so I have a lot of personal stake in this and so it has them successful like I said in maintaining in eliminating a lot of those top box that we had before okay so I know I promised that this talk was not about a transition to micro services I only slightly lied you know there is a part of our stack that needed to change and that is this real-time messaging service and really this was motivated by the need to handle these share channels the original message server architecture was very fundamentally built around the idea that a single message server have all of the data around for a given workspace and so I've managed all of the pub/sub interactions for every channel all of the metadata updates for every user and that just isn't gonna fly in the model where a channel no longer belongs solely to one workspace and so we need to do something about we consider a lot of things we can replicate that the shared channel data between the cooperating listed service but the team come together and decided that this was action the case in which decomposing this monolith into a bunch of services did make sense and so in this world we've refactored that message server system into five really main cooperating services I feel a little bit like I can't call this micro service but there are five and they all do you serve a separate purpose and this is kind of how they fit into the architecture users connect their WebSocket to process that we knocked on the Gateway server it replaces that message proxy box that I have up there before the Gateway server manages subscriptions to a number of channel servers that are responsible for the call core publish/subscribe system an administrative service tier is responsible for maintaining the cluster topology and then there's a separate present server tier that's really just responsible for distributing good service and say yeah say that again right here each of these services have their own bespoke roles but it turns out we had to keep that legacy message server to your around I'll talk about this a little bit but there's a feature whereby we could schedule messages for broadcast in the future it was used by some of our integrations that turned out to not actually have a great home in our service decomposition so we just kept that in the old tier but it's just running many many fewer of them they're actually much less critical to the operation of the site but so with this refactoring we were able to change the fundamental model in this message server system by decomposing things not by workspace but by chimp and so the overall pub/sub system is now a very generic it's a very generic system in which everything is a channel in the system and that is not just the channels that contain messages in slack but every user has their own channel ID and so if you make an update to your profile that gets fanned out according to a subscription for a given user ID every workspace has profile information that has its own fan out for kind of cross workspace information and some of the service has become much more generic and therefore much simpler to reason about clients then subscribe to the objects of their interest using this much more generic and aggressive so fundamentally this is really let us adapt our real tetanus adjusted to accommodate some of these more shared channel news cases again just like before we subscribe to updates for all the relevant objects we've decomposed the service and to clear responsibilities this was not Tibetan see those comments before this actually was a micro service refactor in the service of computer science and not for developer philosophy it's actually the same development team that works on all these but this was really a goal of refactoring this to enable the architecture to better meet the needs of the site as opposed to anything around kind of independent development now one thing that emerge from this is a a given user no longer dependence on just one message server being available in fact I as a user might be to subscribe to tens hundreds of channels hundreds more user channels and so one of the elements of this that ended up happening was the failures of the service ended up being much more widespread and so we've designed some additional systems to ring-fence sort of some of the cascading failures because now each user is not the kind many more of the back-end servers so we lost a little bit of the failure isolation that we had very naturally in the workspace sharted model I'll talk about that a little bit later we get to some of the themes these changes but overall these three fundamental we were three kind of fundamental changes in the slack architecture have really helped us and enabled us to scale to the needs of our site right now both from the standpoint of scale as well as the point of the user requirements on the product okay so looking at some of these few things there are a few things that I thought would be worth to polygon has kind of cross-cutting pass backs and this changes the first was that we've really moved away from this concept of our heard of the pets in many in all of these systems actually we no longer have hand to being servers that are individually replaced by humans when they fail instead the the services that contribute to this overall architecture self-register in the service match other services are responsible for discovering them and that's really enabled our operations team to have much less manual toil the other guy we now have a much harder dependency on our service and our distribution system we use pencil no comment we we have some challenges because although we're working through it but really it's been a big change in the way that you think about kind of the dependency tree for the site has this much bigger kind of need on this topology management and service discovery system and then Holly Hollander talked yesterday about on co-op black really touched on this third bullet if you didn't see her talk my encouragement about the video but when we changed when we introduced these new architectural components as the engineering team approved this actually was a big contributing factor to how we had to change the concept of service leadership a non-qualified before those five boxes were really easy to think about so anybody can kind of jump into the bug and diagnose the system with all of this refactoring these more complicated services we actually needed much more specialized knowledge to both isolate and then debug and diagnose the problems and so the kind of engineering culture then the concept of service of ownership really followed the architectural design it's almost the universe of Conway's law we're kinda we did this thing and then we needed to adopt our architectural or organizational design to match the architecture I mention before how this fine-grain sharding really did help it help to leave in a ton of the local identity servers but we really did start to get into some of these challenges when there were operations that no longer really round everything a single chart I only do this before about the subscriptions that a given user has for all of the channels and all of the users in their organizations but it applies also to the database yet there are certain cases in which you actually do need to get the information about a whole bunch of channels for example to render that sidebar really like it's a complicated thing respect to do you have to figure out all the channels you're in with the last message you read in that channel and what the last message that was written in that channel there's no brain way to sharp that in a way that's both scoped to you kind of what if I subscribe to and spoke to the channel what does that run written that in that channel and so we've had to adopt the site and adapt the service to accommodate the fact that as part of Augean might be to get a whole bunch of data from a bunch of different charts one of the person that we've done for that is actually relaxing some of the consistency requirements and in adopted the clients to accept partial results and so that means that when the client was to fetch that information it can bound how much time it's willing to wait for me shark and if it exceeds that threshold we will return whatever information we can in the client and trust that they will call back again later to fill in the gaps on that missing information it's a Mis behemoth of being able to prepare for potential unavailability has really helped us still accommodate that scattered these case without making every client and every action depend on every back-end server she's pretty bad for resiliency ability and also for performance because the slowness charge is always the slowest sharp and so if I have to talk to 100 then all of my operations are as slow as the hundreds slow she'll know one thing that hasn't really occurred to me before making this slight leg is just how few boxes I actually removed from the architectural diagram that I showed you before so with only one exception everything that was on there in 2016 is actually still part of our productions back today there's a bunch of reasons for this legacy clients are one reason their client doesn't still connect not through the flannel path because they're either a third party integration or some old Windows Phone sitting out there somewhere that we still support you do support this phone and then and then to this before about the database migrations those interested they take time we have terabytes and terabytes of data lots hike ups until making sure that migration can be done safely when you're trying to both recharge the data change the data model and in many cases we've suffered from a little bit of a second system defect where we have a table it works one way we have a long tail of things we've always wanted to do on that table boy wouldn't it be nice to couple those new features with the data migrations we have to do right now anyway and so that's actually caused a little bit of attention in how aggressively we move the data off those legacy shards into this new system the other thing I feel like really important to find out is how these really grand architectural refactorings I really useful they were essential for us to be able to manage the growth of the site but there's also been hundreds of little kind of little supercritical not so glamorous performance capable changes that we've done in the back-end system as we've seen various hot spots come through so again it's true they needed a lot of these three factors but things like adding additional captioning removing expensive database queries those are hugely important to getting these kind of you know parade of oh my god things are terrible - oh great kind of things one pattern isn't really important to us is adding jitter to our client operations to avoid some of these thundering herd's there have been those of us who describe the basics flat client has a nice lead organs commanding control botnet because it is sitting out there is very efficient pub/sub system just waiting to take commands from the backend and sometimes those commands cause it to go turn on and das our system and so one of the patterns that we've needed to do is really look at that thinking about operations where you know if we did them have a hundred thousand or millions of people at a time what would it actually do and then spread those out over time a simple jitter or delays or deferring actions that might not have to do that kind of cooperation between the client side and the server side for us at least has proven really essential to come in keeping the site moving as we've been making these bigger more sweeping changes to the overall architecture so in general this is the picture that - this is the nice happy picture than we are now it's more complicated for sure but many of in fact all of these changes were super important for us to be able to both meet the big-scale demands of our customers and accommodate these new shared channels these cases that complicated involved we're not doing yet I thought that we were talking about some other things we haven't done and some of the things that maybe future slack employees might talk about but I felt like I had to put up this services you can post my one thing we do so how to drive you monolith we suffer from some of the challenges at a large engineering organization kind of working on that model to code and they're in some you know some efforts and thinking about how they wanted you can post that much a long ones what the great folks who preceded me in this room talked it up at some point we will be in multiple storage backends we'll need to figure that out that these synchronous chopped you now I wish there's just some really good room for improvement there again continuing on the scale and resiliency features of the product and then this this whole vector and eventually consistency is going to be super important to future scaling in stock where the more that we can adapt the client so that it still has that real-time feel for the things that really need to be real-time that is able to tolerate some latency or some lag in the back end because I think it's been a super important for us to continue to have the kind of gradual become important so I hope this is interesting I think I'm up for time for questions than I thought I would in the practice so let's rush [Applause]\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: so you're using slack at home or at work and you want to build a bot for it you checked out some of the other bots that are out there but none of them quite do what you want them to do so if you're running slack and want to build your own bot and maybe learn a little bit of javascript along the way join me as we build a slack bot in javascript in just a few minutes hey welcome back so i'm techno tim and today we're going to talk about building your own slackbot in javascript as a quick reminder i stream every tuesday thursday and saturday so if you want to continue the conversation about slackbots there we can so let's talk about building a bot for slack so if you aren't familiar with slack slack is a communication tool it allows you to chat and i am do video calls and also do voice calls it's used by a lot of small businesses and a lot of large ones too and i even use it for personal use for a monitoring tool for all of my services now i don't need to go into detail as to why you would use something like slack but it's a great chat communication tool and if you want to customize slack a little bit more than just what they give you you can build your own bot to reply to custom commands commands that you want to listen for and you want to execute so today in this video we're going to build a slack bot we're going to start with nothing and end with a bot that you can add to your own server today and you can continue to add features to this bot as time goes on now i'm making this bot open source 2 so look for the documentation links in the description below and while you're down there don't forget to give it a thumbs up and subscribe if you haven't already so with that out of the way let's hop right in the first thing we'll do is go out to slack.com once there you'll sign into your workspace if you have one if not let's create one so we're going to create a new workspace then we'll name our workspace so let's name ours techno tim this next step is really just creating a channel so we'll call it coding next we won't invite anybody to this workspace and now we can see our workspace in slack then you can sign in to the slack app next we'll actually need to create an app for our bot okay so we'll go out to the slack api here's where things differ a little bit so we're going to actually create a classic app and you don't need to worry too much about this but this is the only way that i found to create a slack bot that listens on websockets now the alternative is building out an api that accepts webhooks but that's a lot of infrastructure just to listen to chat messages so slack recommends creating a classic app if you want to connect on a websocket this will really simplify creating our app so we'll actually want to go out to the classic apps page and so let's create one here so i'm going to name it techno bottle let's choose our workspace create app and so we've already created our app or our bot so let's add some features to our app so we'll expand add features and functionality then we'll choose bots and here i'm going to choose add legacy bot user choose our bot display name technobotto the username is going to be the same and we'll add next we'll install this app to our workspace install app to workspace click allow and now our bot's added to our workspace so this app credentials section you should keep private treat all of this like a secret that you wouldn't want anyone to see i'm showing you mine now for the sake of this tutorial but you would never show anyone this page plus i'm going to delete all this when i'm done and then if you scroll down to display information we can customize our bot here so i'm going to give them the description be helpful we can give our bond an icon we can choose a background color for it then we'll save our changes okay now that we have our bot created in slack let's start writing some code so the first thing we're going to do is make a directory for our bot once we're in here let's initialize the package.json npm init package name yes version we'll start with zero that zeroed at zero description a helpful slack bot entry point we'll say okay for now we'll change this later test command no test for now get repository none for now keywords none author techno them license sure is this okay yes okay so let's launch vs code okay so i wanted to call this out really quick you'll need to have your environment set up to do javascript development if you need help with this i've got a guide on how to configure your machine for javascript development it will walk you through setting up your machine so that you can develop javascript it'll have you up and going in just a couple of minutes i highly recommend checking that out if you get any errors along the way okay so let's get back to this so here we'll want to create a folder source folder to house our code and here we'll want to create an index.js and let's create a app.js so now we'll need to install some dependencies the first one i'm going to install is esm this allows us to use es6 imports so yarn add esm next we're going to install one of the slack clients slack has many different clients depending on how you want to interact with their services this first one we're going to install is the rtm api so the rtm api is for real-time messaging basically a way to open up a websocket and listen for messages so let's add that with yarn add at slack rtm api this is a scoped package the next we're going to install is the actual slack web api so the web api gives you an http client that we can interact with slack in a restful way so this allows us to get resources and post resources we'll use it to post messages so we'll do yarn add add slack web api okay they're both added let's go back to vs code let's look in our package.json and here you'll see the three dependencies we just added in order to use esm we need to do something like this in our index.js so we need to require our esm and then export our app.js once we do that we can use es6 imports instead of using require everywhere now that's just a personal preference for me from doing front-end development like react.js but you're free to use requires if you want to okay so in our app.js the first thing we're going to do is import our rtm client this is our real-time messaging client so that we can subscribe to events from slack then we need to initialize our client and we need to do that with a token so let's go back out to the slack api where our app was and get our token so if you go back out to your slack app and then go to add features and functionality and then go to permissions once we see our tokens here you'll want to copy this one bot user oauth access token so copy that out and remember these are secrets and while we're at it let's create a constants file to tuck this away so we'll export const slack on token with our token and also you should probably use an environment variable or something else to keep this secret but we'll keep it in here for the sake of this demonstration okay so we'll import the token and we'll pass it into the client and now that we have that let's actually subscribe to an event so let's subscribe to the ready event and on this ready event we're going to just console log out that the bots started okay a couple things we'll need to change in our packets.json so first let's change our main so our entry point isn't index.js anymore it's just source and then we'll just need to add our start script which is just gonna run node okay and so now that we have that done let's actually add our start so this is where we actually start the client then we'll add a cache to log out there if we get an error okay after we add that we should be able to start our bot out so let's go back into our terminal and do yarn start we started and we got a console log on bot started so that means we're right in here so our bot is ready and the cool thing is if you go into your slack app you should see in your apps that your bot is online so now our bot is online and connected to our slack server okay before we make things too complicated let's just send a simple message from our bot so as i mentioned before we use the rtm client to subscribe to events but sending out a message isn't subscribing to an event so we need to use their web api so here we'll need to import the web client and then we'll need to new up a web client with that same token so in order to send a message i created this really quick helper function so this function is called send message and it sends a message it takes a channel and a message and then it calls our web client chat post message and then it's passing in the channel and text of message and we can actually do shorthand here but i'll keep it to be less confusing and so now that we have that function we can use it let's do send message let's send it to the general channel and let's send a message just saying the bot is online let's clean this up let's stop our old bot starter new and here we go we started up the bot and now the bot is saying in our general channel bot online so this is working pretty good but let's change this let's create a new channel we don't want our bot to spam general every time it comes online so let's create a channel called botspam a channel for bot spam okay and this channel can be called anything you want it to be i'm just creating one channel dedicated to all of our bot spam something like automated messages okay so we will go back in our code and let's change the channel to bot spam save it start our bot backup and here it goes bought online in our bot spam channel but not in our general this is the one from earlier but i'll clean it up so it's less confusing and then let's move this to our constants file so that we can configure it easier later so let's export const bot spam channel and you can change this to any channel you have just remember to actually create this channel and then update it here okay so let's import it and then we'll use it here should be able to start it again and see another message okay that's working pretty good let's do one more thing to our bot when it comes online so something i like to do when the bot comes online is just print out the version that the bot's running on so we'll do this const package.json equals require package.json so what we're doing is requiring our package.json and then from our package.json we're going to use the version property to echo out when the bot starts up so let's say bot version package.json.virgin is online and so if we look at our package.json it's just going to echo out this version and that should be incremented when you tag and deploy your bot okay so let's start it again there we go bot version 0.0.0 is online so as you increment your bot you should tag it with the new version and increase this version on your package.json then when it comes online you'll know what version of the bot you're using if not you can just delete that piece anyway okay so now that we have that running let's hook into our events so that we can listen for commands and act on them so really quickly i'm going to add a command like hello and when the bot sees the command hello it's going to respond with heya and then the username now i'm going to follow a bot pattern command exclamation point hello this is similar to other chat clients that are out there but for the record this will not be a slash command i think that slash commands require apis and web hooks and that's a lot of infrastructure to build just for a simple bot so i think it'll go something like this so first we want to subscribe to the slack underscore event event in that callback we'll get an event type and an event and so just to check to see if this is working let's log out the event type and the actual event so let's start back up let's go into general let's type hi and you might see some stuff on the left those are system notifications or system events from slack hanging a pong going back and forth to make sure the websocket's still open but we're not seeing any of my messages and i figured out that that's because we haven't invited the bot to this channel now we see him listed as an app but he's not actually in this channel it's just me by myself so to invite him let's just add him so we'll do at technobotto let's invite him to the channel now he's in the channel you'll see a lot of events fire especially their their famous knock brush mp3 sound that you hear now let's type hi there we go so we had a message of hi from this user in this channel and so we're seeing ids here but that's okay you could even see when you press each keystroke we're seeing a user typing event and there it goes okay so now that this is working let's add some logic first let's do some null checking if event and then event dot type equals equals equals message so here we're checking to see that we have an event and we're checking to make sure that the event type is a message so we don't want typing messages or system messages we only want the type message now let's check the contents of that message so if event dot text equals equals equals hi let's get rid of these console logs so it's not so noisy let's go back to our bot start it back up type high nothing happened exclamation point high there we go and we got a high in our console so that means we're inside of that block so here we mentioned we wanted to have the command hi or hello and if someone used that command we were actually going to say hello back so let's actually just change this to hello and let's create a really quick function called hello so this function is actually going to take a channel id then we're going to send a message to that channel then we're going to say the message of heya here we're going to call the function hello and we're going to pass in a channel id so what's our channel id well if we look in our logs we can see that our channel id is right here this was the channel that someone typed it in now it's not a good idea to use general or modspam for this because we want to respond back in the channel that they sent the message on so this looks like it's hanging off event.channel so let's add that okay let's start our bot back up and let's use the command hello and our bot says heya now this should work in any channel too so let's go into random which we've never typed in say hello and it didn't work that's because we didn't add the bot to this channel so let's invite him so now we invited him so now he can listen on this channel just type in hello there he goes hey yeah okay now that we've got that working we actually want to mention the person that said hello to us so for this we'll need a user id how do we get the user id well we have it in that event message so let's go back and look at that so if we see in this event our user id is right here and that's not a username but i'll show you how to mention someone from a user id so when we say hello we're going to say event dot user and now hello is actually going to take another parameter which is user id and now here when we call send message will actually say angle bracket add user id closing angle bracket okay so what's going on here is that when this event fires we have a user hanging off this event and that's actually an id then we're going to call hello and we're going to pass in the channel id as well as the user id and here's how you mention someone by user id so it's angle bracket at and then our user id is a string angle bracket so let's give it a shot yarn start starter bob back up now we can say hello and there we go our bot's saying hey yeah techno tim and this is actually a mention and that's how easy it is to create a chat bot for slack we started out with nothing and ended up with a fully functional bot that you could add to your server today and you can continue to expand upon this with new features now i'm making the spot open source so it'll be in my github repo and you'll find links in the description below under documentation i'd love to see a pull request for a feature that you find helpful or even just leaving it in the comments below if you'd like to see a part two to this where we continue to expand this spot you could also leave that in the comments below and as a quick reminder i stream every tuesday thursday and saturday so if you have a question about this video or any of my other videos hop in my stream and i'd love to have you so thanks so much for watching and until next time stream on my friends am i getting him come on come on am i getting him yeah yeah i got him give me some repairs i don't even want to get out to repair because someone's totally gonna this was the worst repairing and like having someone come steal your tank as you're repairing i forgot all about this yes please do not steal my tank because because i just took that other tank out\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: hey how's it going my name's booker and in this video i'm going to show you how to build a group chat similar to slack using react.js and chat kits which is a developer tool that my team and i are building here at pusher in the end we'll have an app where users can send and receive messages see who's typing with nifty typing indicators and to top it all off a real time who's online list the app we're going to build is going to resemble slack and it could well be used for team communication but i realized having built the project and recorded the video yesterday but the concepts and techniques we're going to look at could be used for most types of chat applications be that a customer messaging app maybe for a crm maybe a group chat for your community or even in-game chat if you're a game developer i wanted to quickly mention that all the code is on github the link is in the description and i even took the liberty of writing up a step-by-step tutorial based on the exact same code you're going to see in this video so if you want to follow along you can maybe watch the video and reference the code on github it's up to you if at any point you find yourself enjoying the video please drop a like on the youtube video you can also follow me on twitter i'm at booker currents but yeah i'm excited let's dive in instead of starting from complete scratch we're going to download a starter template i created earlier we'll have a poke around the code in just a second to see exactly what's happening but first off download this repository which you can do by coming here and clicking on download zip or by copying the link and heading to the terminal but we can run git clone followed by the link to the repository followed by the name of the local folder you want to download that code into if we navigate into that folder we can run npm install to bring in those local dependencies pretty standard stuff if we open the project up we can see that there aren't really that many files in this public folder we have an index.html file this mainly exists just to give us something to mount our react application onto we won't be touching this html file going forward instead of source we have some basic react application files including an empty components directory where we'll be creating some of our components as we go forward the real meat here is this app.js file which we'll add more code to as we go forward but right now just renders a simple component with the text slack if we look at package.json you can see that we're using react scripts to run the react application and we also have a start script where we can run both the server which i'll show you in a second as well as the clients all with one command the server is actually the main reason this template exists i didn't want to spend too much time explaining how to set up a simple express js server because if you already know express this here is going to look super familiar to you it does need explaining if you don't know express very well which is totally okay then it doesn't really matter too much we're not going to spend very much time on the server now the first thing we're going to want to do when the user loads our application is ask them what is your username we'll use this username to create a chat kit user to capture that username we're going to create a username form component and we're going to create that component inside of the components directory i just showed you first we'll import react then we'll create our username form components inside the username form we'll create a constructor but take some props and we'll immediately pass those props to the super function we'll also set some initial state for our application [Applause] next we'll create a render function we'll return a simple form [Music] whenever this input here is updated or changed we're going to call vista on change [Music] and then whenever the form is submitted we're going to call vista on submit we'll also need to go back up to the constructor and bind both of those functions to this nice so this is a pretty standard react form what we're doing is we're creating a controlled component but whenever the user enters some inputs we update our component state whenever the form is submitted we take that component state up here and we pass it to the on submit prop which we expect whoever's referencing this form to pass in fact let's reference this form now just to make sure everything is in order so we'll go to app.js and import username form from components slash username form and then instead of returning just the text slack let's return the username form specify that on submit prop and we'll just say when we get the username let's alert it just to make sure things are in order so that now if i create a new split and run the application using npm run start or actually we can just do npm start for short that should spin up a server so that we can go to localhost 3000 enter a username like booker and when we hit submit we can capture that username and show it in an alert but actually we don't want to just show it in a in an alert whenever this user enters their username we want to send that to our server application and create a chat kit user but before we can do that we must first create a chat kit application or a chat kit instance so head to pusher.com chat kit and click sign up you'll have to create a new account i already have one so i'll log into an existing account real quick once you're at the dashboard and the chat kit click create new and create a new chat kit instance i'm going to call mine slack clone the way chat kit works essentially is that you install a chat kit client sdk there are sdks for javascript swift and android we'll be using javascript and then you can subscribe to a room where you'll receive an event every time a new message is sent on the same client you can also send messages you can send plain text or you can send files so you can send video messages audio messages whatever you like once you have this kind of fundamental chat in place it becomes quite easy to add things like typing indicators and online user presence which i'll show you how to do later in this video right now i just want you to take notes of the keys tab in the dashboard where you can see your instance locator and secret key we'll need these in just a second now most interactions in chat kit they happen on the clients like i just showed you there are client sdks for javascript swift and android and you can even use these libraries together so you could build a web application as well as an android application and they can both communicate using chat kit which is kind of cool but if you head to the docs you can see that there are both client sdks and server sdks most interactions with chat kit happen on the clients that's the same most code will write will use the client sdks but we'll also need to use the node.js server sdk to create and manage users so what i'll do is i'll copy this installation command head to the terminal and install pusher chat kit server now we have that sdk installed we can open up server.js and import chat kit from pusher dash chat kit dash server and then we can create our own local chat kit instance by calling new chat kit.default and we pass to this constructor function firstly our instance locator and secondly our secret key both of which we can access from the dashboard so let's copy that instance locator and paste it in and then let's copy that secret key and paste it in like so now the main purpose behind this server is to accept a post request from the client with the user's username when we receive that username we want to create a chat kit user with that username we have to do this on the client because it needs to happen securely you can only create a user if you have this secret key and in order for it to be secret it has to remain on the server so what we'll do is we'll come down here and create a new route handler called users that takes a post request and as soon as that endpoint gets hit we're going to bring out the username from the request body once we have that username we're going to call chat kits dot create user specify the user's name to the username and we're also going to specify their id to be equal to the username when that function is finished executing we're going to send a status of 201 to the client to indicate that the user has been created successfully it's possible that an error will occur and in this particular case it's particularly possible that the user enters a username that already exists a username which is already in use by another chat kit user for this particular chat kit instance in that case we're going to get a specific error um and for our application that's actually okay we don't mind if somebody enters a username but already exists because we're going to assume they're kind of revisiting the application so what we're going to do is we're going to check the error type and check if it's equal to services slash chat kit slash user user underscore already underscore exists and if the user already exists we're going to send a status of 200 to indicate that the request was still successful otherwise we're going to send a status equal to the error status code we're going to relay that from chat kit to our client and we're also going to pass down the error json uh just in case we need to use to do some debugging later down the line let's test this out real quick let's create a new split and run the server and then in another split i'm going to run curl specified that we want to send a json request a post request and we'll specify here the username to be equal to foo and we want to send this post request to http localhost 3001 slash users and we should see when we run this that the user is created and indeed the user is created now imagine that the user just entered that username on the form and they created their account then maybe they closed the tab and they came back later they're going to enter the same username we don't need to create the user because it already exists but we don't expect an error so if we rerun this command now we shouldn't be seeing an error but we are let's debug this real quick we can see that the error type is equal to services slash chat kit slash user already exists now what i tried to do earlier is make sure that if the error was equal to that that we didn't actually um relay the error and i think what i've done is actually mistyped the error type so let's save that real quick restart the server and then we'll try this again this time with a different username just to make sure in fact actually we can use the username foo again if we run this we should see that we get an okay response you'll notice that when we created the user for the first time it said created when we kind of re-log in we just see okay as successful but we have some indication that the user wasn't created the request was successful next we can go back to app.js and instead of just alerting the username like we do here we can send it to the server via post request first let's create a function to handle the submission and then update the on submit prop we'll also need to create a constructor make sure to bind this.on username submitted to this when the form is submitted we're going to use the fetch function to send a post request to localhost for 3001 slash users fetch takes a second argument which lets us specify the request method we'll be sending a post request as well as any headers and of course the body of the request which is going to be the username when this function's finished executing we're going to get the response for now we'll just write to the console success if an error happens we'll console.error the error [Music] we'll also need to call super in the constructor and then if we run the server and we should see if we return to the application reload the page and open the developer tools but under the network tab when we submit a username like bar a post request is sent to the server and we get like a status code of 201 created imagine the user closes the tab and comes back and tries to answer their username again we should see this time that we get 200 okay so this is the exact same result we saw in the terminal earlier but now we're seeing in the browser which is one step closer to completing our application you know right now when the user submits their username nothing visibly happens really when they send their username after we send that post request successfully we want to transition them to a different screen we want to show them the chat application so let's create another container component for that chat screen right now we're going to create it in the source directory and it's going to be called chatscreen.js this is going to be a component like the ones we've defined before so let's import react and then create a simple component within app.js we'll want to import the chat screen and then in the constructor we're going to set some initial states we're going to set a current screen property and by default that's going to be equal to what is your username screen while we're here we're also going to create another property for the current username basically when the request has been successfully sent we're going to want to come here and set the current username equal to the username submitted by the user we need to store it in our application state so we can pass it to the chat screen component in just a second we're also going to want to say that once the form has been successfully submitted we're going to update the current screen to be the chat screen that way if we come down here to the render method we can say if this dot state dot current screen is equal to what is your username screen then we're going to return the username form otherwise if this dot state dot current screen is equal to the chat screen we're going to return the chat screen and we're going to pass down the current username which will be equal to this.state.com username if i run the application oh and excuse me i've made a typo here we can enter a username like bob and when we hit submit we'll see that after the request has been sent we get rendered the chat screen in fact what we can do which is kind of cool is go to the chat screen component and we can access this.props.current username and we could say something like uh hello current username so that now if i sign in as like booker and hit submit you can see it says hello booker moving on we're going to need to install the chat kit client sdk and then import it inside of our chat screen component within component did mounts we're going to create a new chat manager just like when we instantiate a chat kit on the server we have to specify our instance locator which again we can access from the chat kit dashboard we also need to specify the user id which is going to be equal to this.props.current username just like we referenced down here we'll also need to provide a chat kit token provider and we're going to specify the url to be http localhost 3001 slash authenticate now as you can probably discern this is pointing to the server we've been working on earlier but we haven't created this authenticate routes i'm going to do this really quick but i'm actually going to paste it from my clipboard as i'm not going to explain it in too much detail if you're following along copy this code exactly authentication is basically the act of proving a user is who he or she says she is in a real application on your server you would typically have some logic to kind of verify that the user is who he or she says she is in our case we're just going to assume everybody is who they say they are and return a chat kit token no matter what the jacket token is returned by this authenticate function but that's all we really need to understand right now let's save that and go back to our chat screen here now we have our chat manager we can call chat manager dot connect so you connect to chat kit once we've connected we should get back the current chat kit user which right now i'm just going to print to the console if something goes wrong which isn't likely in this case i'll write the error to the console just so we can do some debugging let's run this now to see what happens what we should see is that when we reload the application and open the developer tools if i connect as booker hit submit we actually do get an error we get a status code of 401 user id mismatch what if something goes wrong which isn't likely in this case which isn't likely in this case isn't likely in this case hmm i think what's likely here is that we have a problem with the authenticate endpoint which is ironic because i copy and pasted it i think what we need to do actually is specify a user id property here and not pass an additional argument if i save that and quickly restart the server hopefully now we'll see when we reload the page and try and create an account and connect to chat kit that we get the current user awesome you can poke around here and kind of get a look at the stuff available to you when you're using chat kit um but the basic idea now is that when we have this current user we can start to perform actions in our chat what we'll do firstly actually is head to the dashboard and to the inspector tab the inspector is a simple tool to help you kind of do basic development and basic testing with chat care what we're going to do is we're going to create a room to create a room we firstly have to create a user it doesn't really matter we're not going to actually use that user and then we're going to create a room called general when we create the room we're going to see the room id which we should copy or at least keep open in this tab so we can reference it afterwards i'm using the inspector to create a room for this tutorial just to keep things simple but realistically you are likely to create your rooms programmatically if you look at the docs for the node sdk or even the um client-side javascript sdk there are functions you can call to create rooms i just want to keep things simple so i'm using the dashboard right here now in a second we're going to make it so that we can subscribe to messages that are sent in that room but first i'm going to create a new component in the components directory called messagelist.js and this is going to be the component responsible for rendering a list of messages for a particular conversation or room the basic idea here is that in the render function i'm going to return a container and then we're going to take a messages prop that we expect whoever's referencing this component to pass down and we're going to map each message to a list item elements actually let's make this a ul instead of a div all right now i'm going to go back to chat screen and i'm going to create a constructor for this component where i'll set some initial states in particular we want to create a messages property then once we've successfully connected to chat care rather than just print out the um current user we're actually going to write current user dot subscribe to room we'll specify the room id to be the room id that we copied just a second ago from the dashboard we'll specify the message limits to the 100 and i'll explain this property a bit more in a second and then we're going to create a hooks property excuse me hooks not books where when a new message is received we're going to call this dot set state and we're going to take that new message and we're going to essentially add it to the existing messages array i'm going to quickly make sure that i the promise returned by subscribe to room so that down here i can call um then and access the current room we'll need this in just a little bit most likely next what i'm going to do is go down to the render function and i'm going to render the message list in fact let's import it real quick from components message list and then down here i can reference the message list and say the messages are equal to this.messages now what we should see if we save this file and run the application is that after i reference super which i always forget for some reason we should be able to go to the app reload the page create a new user or sign in with an existing user and then from even the chat kit dashboard we can actually send some test messages so if i send the text hello right here and go back to this tab you can see that the user called chat kit dashboard has written the text hello in fact if i open up these windows side by side you can see that as i type messages and hit save this interface is updated in real time the next step is to enable the user to enter the message rather than using the dashboard this inspector is handy just as a kind of sanity check we want to make sure that we are subscribing to messages successfully so we can send a test message and make sure it registers the formatting is a bit weird but we'll fix that in just a little bit let's give our user a way to send a message before they can send a message we need to kind of capture the text which we'll do using a form so let's create a new component in the components folder called sand message form dot js and actually this is going to be incredibly similar to the username form we defined earlier so to save some time i'm actually going to open up that username form copy the contents paste this into the send message form and then just do a bit of refactoring [Music] if i then go to app or sorry chatscreen.js i can import vsan message form and then at the bottom here in the render function i can render that send message form and we'll say on submit let's take the text and let's alert it just to make sure things are working fine so if i sign in as booker you'll notice quickly that as i reconnect i get to see all the previous chat kit messages you might recall that earlier inside of the chat screen file we specified a message limit of 100. i just want to use this opportunity to mention that whenever you connect to a chat kit room you have the option to see retroactive messages or sorry to see old historical messages for which the on new message function is called retroactively that's kind of cool but yeah you can see here that we have this what is your text form if we type some text and hit submit we get to see our text but yeah let's actually send this text to chat kit now before we do that let me quickly make a few tweaks to our application states [Music] i'm going to create two new state properties current room and current user once we successfully connect i want to say this dot set state and set the current user on our state down here you might recall that earlier i deliberately created this event function so then now i can come here and say set state current room this will give us wider access to the current room and current user properties so that in this case i can replace the arrow function here with a call to this dot send message i can then create a send message function that takes some text and say this dot state dot current user dot send message we can access current user now you can see we can also say that the room id should be equal to this or state dot current room which we now have access to the id and then we'll specify the text to be equal to the tags submitted by the form before this will run we need to come up here and save this it'll send message equals this or send message dot buying best we're pretty used to doing this by now let's save that run the application and see what happens if i type the text hello and hit submit you can see that the message shows up right here what's kind of cool is if i open up two windows and create another user called ham we can see the text i wrote previously and we can start to talk with each other it's like hi i'm ham oh hey um nice to meet you you get the idea the next thing we'll want to add to our chat application is typing indicators now adding typing indicators with chat kit is actually pretty straightforward it really boils down to two distinct steps firstly whenever the user starts typing so if i'm typing in this field we need to broadcast an event that tells chat kit that a user is typing the second distinct step is to essentially subscribe to that event so that if for example i'm typing in this left-hand window the other clients application will receive an event to say hey booker's typing based on that we can update our ui to show the user who else is typing in a particular room or conversation we'll integrate with chat kit in just a second and things will come together quite swiftly but first we need to make a small tweak to our send message form we need a way to be notified whenever the user types a character in other words whenever the input value is changed we can't do that right now this unchanged prop doesn't exist so we'll quickly add it by going to the components folder and the send message form components and then inside of this unchange function we're going to call this.prop store and change every time the input is updated such for now if i go back to the chat screen and back to the uh render function right here just the test things are working i can pass an arrow function which just writes to the console updated you'll notice that we're not actually capturing the value of the um text input simply because we don't really need it for this and we can always access it via the uh on submit property function anyway but yeah let me just quickly test this before we go any further we've seen a few errors today it's always good to do a little sanity check if i just pop open the developer tools here and quickly enter my username we should see that whenever i type this updated uh messages written to the console that's a great first step but actually we're not too interested in just writing some text to the console what we actually want to do is every time the value is updated we're going to want to send a typing advance which we'll do by this function from here we can access the current user and we call a function called is typing n and we specify the room id the user is typing in which of course we can access viabis.state.currentroom.id and really that's all we have to do fundamentally once we have the events this really boils down to one significant line of code which is pretty cool in fact we'll also just catch an error just in case we need to do some debugging oh and of course as ever we need to come up to the constructor and bind the function we just defined namely sense hyping events to this so yeah that's the first significant step and as you can see it's not even that significant the next thing we need to do is to be notified when another user is typing so we can update our user interface now it's very possible that there will be multiple users typing at the same time and to keep track of this i'm going to create a new state property called users who are typing and that's going to be an array we will update this state in just a second but first we need a way to be notified whenever a user starts or stops typing and the way we do that with chat kit is by specifying a hook earlier we specified an on new message event handler essentially that's called whenever a new messages sends we can also specify an event handler for when a user started typing this event handler receives the user that's currently started typing we can also specify an on user stop typing event handler where again this is the user that stopped typing basically to kind of test this out real quick we can just write to the console and let's just write user started typing and in this case users stopped typing if we save this and quickly run the application in fact let me quickly change this from user to user.name [Music] what we can see is that if i reload the app and then in one window sign in as booker and then this other window is signed in as um let's just call it test user to avoid any kind of confusion as i start to type as test user you can see in the left hand window there in the console the test user started typing i've not stopped typing yet as soon as i move my hand from the keyboard we get an event that says test users stop typing conversely if i open up the console as test user and i start typing as myself as booker you can see the exact same event for the other user however we do not see that event for the current user because there's no benefit really in notifying the current user that they are currently typing of course they know they're typing they're the ones typing with their keyboard the other kind of interesting thing which you might have noticed is that there was and is no need to kind of broadcast an event that says hey the user has stopped typing uh chat kit can figure it out based on how long it's been since it received an event to say that a user is typing which is kind of neat but yeah these events are clearly hooked up correctly that's awesome it's now up to us to update our application state so we can update the user interface for example in this case when the user starts typing what we essentially want to do is add their username to the users who are typing array which we can do using the same technique we saw earlier with the message list when the user stops typing we're going to want to remove their username from that array [Music] what we should be able to do now is go to the render function and then just above the send message form we can say this.state.users who are typing and if we serialize it using json.stringify we should be able to just preview this really quickly in our user interface and before we move on to creating an actual typing indicator component where we can render it in a more proper way [Music] um so yeah let's test this real quick just log in as booker and then as test yeah we can see the bottom here these kind of empty parentheses that's being rendered by react because right now there are no users typing as soon as i start typing his tasks you can see the left window there the test is typing i can start typing you can see the right window what book is typing same kind of thing we saw before but now it's in our ui and what we really want to do is create a new component called typing indicator.js we can pass that um users who are typing object down to and render it properly what we'll do is we'll say if this.props.users who are typing dot length is equal to zero then we know that there is no one typing and we can just return an empty dev otherwise if this.props.users who are typing dot length is equal to one we know that there's currently one user typing and we can return a paragraph tag which is like this.props but users who are typing will bring out that first username and then just concatenate is typing dot dots if there are more than one users more than one user's typing what we'll want to do is a little bit more tricky but still very simple we'll say this.props like users who are typing don't join and what we'll do is we'll just join them what this join function does basically is it takes the array and it returns back a string with each element in the array joined with this particular text so if two users are typing say if bob and jim are typing it will say bob and jim are typing you won't really get to experience this in this screencast it'll be quite hard to demonstrate um i'm pretty sure it'll work fine now if we go back to chatscreen.js and import typing indicator instead of just rendering the text we can render the typing indicator component specify users who are typing is equal to this.state.users who are typing and what we should see when we run this application uh is a much more proper formatting for the list of type a list of users who are typing instead of just an array basically oh i forgot to run the survey [Music] all right so if i start typing we can see ham is typing if i start typing his booker we can see the book is typing um it's really hard to demonstrate but if because i can't really type at the same time with one keyboard but if there were multiple users typing we should see that you know bob and jim are typing you know looking at the application in front of us from a visual standpoint there's clearly a bit of work left to do but from a feature point of view there's only really one more feature we need to add and that's a who's online list where we can see a list of users who've ever joined this chat as well as their online status let's add that next you know i'm not going to spend too much time on nitty gritty styling but i think it might be useful to create a basic layout for our application after all what we really want to see is a sidebar on the left here where we can show a list of online users and on the right hand side we can show the uh chat messages as well as the chat send message form so before integrating with chat care let's set up a basic ui layout what i'm going to do is create a style property on this container dev i'm going to set the display property to flag so i'll be using flexbox to set up the layout of our application within that container i'm going to create a new kind of sub container for all of the elements that i want to be on the right hand side of the page above that i'll create another container this time for the who's online list which i'm going to style very simply by specifying but i want the width to be 30 of the width of the viewports and just to kind of uh give us some visual indication of what's happening i'm gonna set background curly hair and see what happens so if i log in now we can see that we have this who's online list on the left and then our chat messages on the right the first thing that comes to mind is that obviously this isn't filling the full height of the page we can fix that really easily by setting the height property to 100 vh that looks good to me one more small ui layout thing i'll fix is obviously this text input should probably be anchored to the bottom and the way we can do that is by coming down here wrapping the message list in its own container with a style property and we're just gonna set the uh flex property to one well clearly that didn't work that's because i actually need to make sure that um on the container here i set the display to flex and i set the flex direction it's a column there we go you can see that it's pushed down to the bottom obviously you need some padding and some additional styles we'll tackle that afterwards what that flex one property i just added does basically is it tells the browser to make the message list occupy all the space it can while still leaving room for any other elements and because it has that flex one property kind of dominates as you might have guessed by this point we're going to create a new component called who's online list.js the idea here is that we're going to pass down a list of users we're going to check if that user's property exists if it does we'll return the list but otherwise we're going to return the text loading we could return nothing and just render an empty screen but it might be nice to show the loading status and then what we're going to do if there are some users is we're going to return a list inside that list we're going to take each user and map that user to a list item i expect we'll want to make some tweaks to this component but for now let's head back to chat screen and import the who's online list component then down here in the render function instead of just rendering the text who's on my list let's actually render the who's online list and we're going to pass down the user's property which is going to be equal to this.state.currentroom.users and this is actually quite a magical property the reason i say that is that normally in our react application for example when it comes to a list of users who are currently typing we have to manage that state ourselves we're always adding or removing items from an array or an object when it comes to managing users there's no need to manage that state ourselves because the chat kit client sdk does that for us this user's property is always up to date it always reflects the up-to-date state of your chat application so whenever someone get joins they get added to this property if their online status changes whether they go offline or come back online um it's completely reflected by this property which means that when it comes to updating our user interface all we really have to do you know because obviously when someone uh comes online or goes offline we want to update our user interface um we can use hooks like we did for the typing events so we can say when a user comes online rather than updating any kind of state all we really have to do is call this.force update and what that's going to do in turn the same for when a user um went offline or whenever a user joined for that matter whenever any of these events happen we're going to call force updates and what that really translates to in react speakers call this render function again and when this render function gets called again the user's property gets evaluated again and that should reflect the state of our application in fact one thing and like i said we probably were going to end up tweaking that um who's online list one thing we can do is we can come back down here where we return the list item of the username and in parentheses we can render the user.presence.state which is either going to be online or offline we just made a lot of changes at once so we'll see what happens when we run the application yeah i kind of expected after writing that much code i probably made a typo uh which is a quite easy quite an easy fix if i go to chat screen and i think i just need to add commas at the end of each of these uh statements but once that's up and running successfully oops and again i need to call super always always always forget to do that [Music] actually this component doesn't even have a constructor it's because i mistyped components here i think cool let's see what happens if i log in and we see that loading text once we're connected now this is cool um we see a list of all the users who've ever joined this room like throughout this tutorial i connected as then his test then as test user if i open another window real quick now watch this take a look at um test user right here currently test users offline but as soon as i join that offline tags changes to online which is super cool the other cool thing is that if i hit back here basically closing the chat app pay attention to test users online status boom test user goes offline and one more thing i want to test is that if i create a new user and i join the room we should see that new user yes gets added to the list of online users and that pretty much integrates with the same kind of system you know if we close the tab that user appears offline wicked and that looks awesome to me i'm going to pause the screencast and i'm going to take a bit of time off camera making this chat application look a bit better but all the basic functionality is there which i'm really excited about all right i made some updates if i run the application and log back in you can see it looks a lot better now trust me you might think it would have been nice to see me add the style step by step but it was fiddly a bit boring and really a bit outside the scope of this tutorial besides the complete code is on github where you can browse it download it adapt it maybe even use it as the foundation for your next app chat kit is a tool i'm helping to build a pusher i'm really excited about it if you think it can save you time and help you build a better product faster the team and i would love to help you are very very welcome to join our slack channel where you can reach the team and i directly with your questions there'll be a link in the description as well on all of our documentation pages we have a chat if you want to pop up there of course i would love to hear your thoughts about this video or indeed check it in the comments section as well thank you so much for watching i really hope you found it interesting i've been like booker goodbye\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: if you're like me and you dream of building the next instagram twitter or facebook there are two features your application is for sure going to need the first one is real time messaging unicorns like tinder over instagram or twitter they all have some sort of direct messaging system and the apps like slack twitch or youtube rely very heavily in real time public chat rooms the second feature is activity fits which is something that apps like instagram or twitter are literally built upon if your app allows users to follow each other and you want to show to your users the posts and activities of the people they follow you need an activity feed or if you're building a notifications tab where your users can see that somebody like their photo or somebody mentioned them on a comment you need a notifications feed implementing these two features by yourself real time messaging and activity feeds it's possible but not so easy for the chat you need to code and maintain the real-time servers that should be capable of holding many websocket connections open for all the people in the chat room you also need to code all the logic to handle channels messages private channels reactions threads among many other things and for the feeds you need to code all the logic for follows on follows likes mentions pagination fan out so many things or you can save your time and you can use stream instead a stream is a backend as a service platform that allows you to implement real-time chat messaging and activity feeds in record time and the best of all is absolutely free for makers like you and me companies like soundcloud strava adobe master class and etoro among many many others use a stream for real-time chat messaging and activity feeds stream also has sdks for vanilla javascript react.js react native flutter android ios unity and even unreal engine and if that wasn't enough a stream also has a collection of ui components that we can use to save even more time when implementing chats or activity feeds if you want to get started right now click on the link below to sign up for your free maker account or keep watching because to see how easy it is to work with stream we are going to implement our own real-time chat using the stream chat api and the stream react chat components now before we start i need to warn you stream is going to blow your mind after we sign up for stream and get a free maker account we will create a new app for this we have to select the region we want the code and the data to be next we're going to create a new channel type with a channel type we can customize the features the rules and the permissions that our users will have when using our chat stream comes with very useful channel types already made for us for example the live stream chat comes pre-configured with some permissions already that allow logged in users to write in the chat but only allows anonymous users to read the chat or for example the messaging chat comes with some pre-configuration that doesn't allow guests to look at the chat only registered users only thanks to channel types we can also specify what are the events that our users are going to be subscribed to when creating a new channel type all we have to do is write the name and select the events that we are interested on an example of an event is a typing event we should leave this on if we want our users to know when someone is typing a message like in slack or in messenger for example we're going to leave all of them on for now then we're going to write down the permission rules for our chat first we will allow the admin which is us to do whatever we want and then we're going to allow guest users to be able to create channels write messages react to messages upload files and send links now we are done with the configuration we can now go to our react application first we have to install the stream chat npm package then we're going to grab our api key from the settings page of our application and use it to connect from our code then when our application starts we're going to connect to stream using a guest user with a random id after that we will now create or connect to a channel with the channel type that we created before we will give it a name and we will save this channel in the state now that we are connected you will install the ui react components that are provided for us by stream for free all we have to do is npm install a stream chat react and then all we have left to do is to render the components and this is the mind-blowing part stream gives us components like chat channel and window that will render a chat window on the channel that we are connected to if we want to show a header on the channel to display the name of the channel and to display a count of how many people are currently online all we have to do is render the channel header component as you can see we can see the result immediately in our screen now if we want to show a list of messages in our channel all we have to do is render the message list component now because we don't have any messages yet we have to allow our users to write the messages instead of creating an input manually and doing all the code by ourselves all we have to do is render the message input component and boom that's it as you can see that gives us an input that works out of the box we can now send messages and even upload files now when all your users connect to our chat they will see the list of previous messages they will know when other users are typing and they will even be able to react to messages with emojis and this is all because we render the right components in the right places and if that wasn't enough if we wanted our users to be able to open threads in messages the ways like that for example all we have to do is render the thread component just by doing that the users can now talk in threads how easy was that it's crazy we just made our own slack clone with writing almost no javascript at all and zero lines of css the string chat react components are super customizable as well here you can see all the components you can use if you want to modify the default look of the message ui they are also full of props that you can change and you can even add class names if you want to change the css directly and of course you don't always have to use the stream chat react components you can use your own components with the chat api thankfully the stream api is very intuitive for example if you wanted to send a message to the channel using code and not the react stream components then you can just do channel that send message that's very easy to remember or if you wanted to listen for new messages in your channel all you have to do is channel on new message or for example if you wanted to add a reaction to a message using your custom emojis all you have to do is run channel send reaction and the name of your reaction now let's take a look at activity streams and see how we would go about building a feed instagram style for activity streams we need a server from the server is from where you will add the notifications to the inbox of the users or activities to their feeds on the server side first we get a user token we do this to control who can read the feed and notifications in our front after we have our token then we get a feed for our user then in the server side when an event happens we will add an activity to the feed of our user we can also make our user follow someone else now if for example we were building a react native application all we would have to do is use the expo activity feed package that a stream provides for free this package has components that will allow us to render our activity feeds doing something like this the expo activity feed package comes with like buttons inputs link previews and even real-time update notifications literally everything you would need to build your own social network as you can see a stream is such a time saver doing what we just did by ourselves we take us a longer time thanks to stream we were able to implement a real-time chat and activity feeds in a matter of minutes and our chat came with features like private channels public channels message reactions with emojis notification of typing threads incredible now the good news is that you can use a stream today the free for makers account gives you free and full access to the chat api for up to 2 000 users per month and it gives you full and free access to the feeds api for up to 9 million feed updates per month click on the link below to sign up today thank you to stream for sponsoring this video and thank you for watching this video let me know in the comments if you would like to see a full tutorial on stream using the chat api to build our own slack clone or if you would like me to use the feed api to build our own twitter or instagram and that's it for this video what do you think of stream have you heard about stream do you want to learn more about stream have you used the stream let me know in the comments i'm going to be looking at them right now thank you so much for watching as always stay happy stay free eat kimchi i'm zamida san angelo see you on the next one bye [Music]\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: what is going on everybody I hope all is well it is your boy John and I'm showing you today how we have mastered asana and slack for consistent communication across the board with our team so I'm just gonna dive right in no presentation just show you a deep dive of how we do this and how we've set up our process so as you can see on the left hand side I've got a sauna live here on the right hand side I have slack here as well so in essence what we try to do is organize a lot of our communication within these two stacks asana on the left hand side this is more for task management right putting the task in here itemizing them and then going ahead and assigning those to individuals within the business on the right hand side is our communication platform for talking in real-time so I'm gonna start with asana and go through our jobs and kind of how we lay out our tasks so for example let's go to on the left hand side you'll see all of these tabs and menu items I know this can be confusing at first especially if you're new to asana I do recommend signing up for asana checking it out getting acclimated some people are more comfortable with base camp or Trello I'm an asana guy and so this is what we use internally for a team so for example I have all of my favorites here and I categorize all of our jobs based on what we do so these are our main functions we do a lot of SEO a lot of web development PPC we have daily jobs that are just kind of random jobs that we work on so I'll actually start there so if I hit daily and I hit daily tasks these are some of the tasks that I work on on a daily right so we have right now running for ad campaigns currently and then I also review the prospect list so this is more so high-level management stuff I just go in I review the accounts I make sure all the team members are on point and then I'll mark these completed and so what I like to do is have the main job right here and then I have subtasks in that job and that helps clean up and archive a lot of this information here is where you can see who the its assigned to and then here is where you have the due date now any time it has this kind of circular arrow that means it's a repeating job right and so this root job it's Monday through Friday and I'm mark and complete each day to make sure that it's done now the reason I set up daily tasks is because these are things that I need to do every day and make sure that I'm doing consistently on a regular basis and this just helps me have a reminder now if I hit this button here I can click this and I can click do date and now everything is organized by due date so I can see what's coming what needs to be worked on and who's working on what so our Rochelle our project manager she needs to add this YouTube video actually to our YouTube channel and work on the thumbnail and then as you can see on the sub job we have a be Abraham our designer he's gonna go ahead and design that thumbnail once that's designed and completed he'll mark that complete or show our project manager will get a notification and then she'll add that on YouTube so I'm a big proponent of trying to automate things and keeping myself kind of out of that day to day so that way I can focus on just managing the team let's go to another one so design right design our designer full-time ad he does an amazing job he has five jobs in the queue right now right and as you can see this job is overdue at January thirtieth now that's the completion date so I'm gonna actually push that back because we always give ourselves about two or three weeks of lead time extra so I'm gonna change that due date to this Thursday so that's gonna move that down here and then this job is actually overdue we're just waiting on response from the client to approve it so once they approve that then we go ahead and move into the next segue so instead of inundating you with all this info I'm gonna go ahead and create a job just to give you guys an example of how we get it done so what I usually do is create a job description document this document is actually in my other course the mock marketing automation Academy and so what we've done is we created templates for every single job within the agency so that can include design UI UX content marketing email marketing this is taking me years to really culminate and create and now we're at a point where our shell our project manager can go in here she can copy a job and paste it in with ease of use but I'm gonna show you an example right so let's say we have a new logo design logo here I'm gonna go to here and then I'm gonna hit design okay so here's the logo design right a nice simple easy job what I usually do and let me zoom in is have the first column be the name of the job the second is the the assignee or the person that's going to be working on it the due date and then any notes that are attributed to those sub jobs so I'll just take this copy it I'll go into asana I'll hit add task alright and so I'm gonna title this logo design and then I'm gonna go here and I'm gonna add a sub task and then I'm gonna paste and as you can see everything is organized and ready to go super efficient assign this is gonna go to a B since he is our designer and then I'm gonna set the due date we usually set it for about let's see about 14 days so about two weeks right so today's a twenty-fifth we're gonna do the eleven now usually Rachelle works on these I just wanted to show you kind of an example right what I also do is add a modifier or a I'm sorry or a project so this is a design project now what I also do and this has helped us tremendously knowing which client we're dealing with is we create an acronym for each one of our clients this is something that I learned working full-time at an agency with my mentor where every client has an acronym so for example let's say we're doing this internally for five for digital maybe we're doing a rebranding so I'm gonna do five four and as you can see now that's added so I always do two project types I do the type of project which can be designed web development whatever it is and then the second one is the client acronym that way every team member knows what they're dealing with now the great thing about these subtasks is you can assign these to individual people so if I go here send logo design document to designer that's for che ten years before a due date right I can go here I can hit this I can do che and then I can say ten days before so let's just say that is v now that's done right so now she specifically assigned that task she's gonna get a notification via email that that's come in and then everyone gets notified via slack and I'll jump into that a little bit in a little bit so to recap I always keep favourites here on the left hand side for jobs who work on the most I also keep our most prominent team members here that work on the most jobs and then I can go in to our job description template which we have dozens and dozens of different jobs and copy and paste that and I recommend what you start doing within your business is starting to itemize and list out your process that way you can create a job template like this and when you create that you can offer that to whenever you're opening a job it's just super easy you don't even have to think about it and you can always perfect this and work on this side know this is all available in my marketing automation course which are also include a link to as well so if I go back to asana I created my job it has the assignments now let's kind of jump into slack and again you guys can sound off below in the comments ask any questions that you have slack is our team communication platform so think of it as whatsapp for business right and so the way this works is you're able to communicate with your team and you have specific channels where you can have certain team members in those channels and you discuss certain subjects so we have everything broken out based on our services so we have content marketing copywriting design PPC project management all that good stuff so if I go to design for example I can see that che just opened a job for a B who has a new job today that he needs to work on now when that job is added all this information is included so it pulls all this data from asana so he can see out of bird's-eye view what jobs he has to work on he's on holiday today that's probably why he didn't respond so he'll get on that first thing tomorrow and he'll know exactly what he needs to do actually let me go ahead and delete this so no one gets confused on the team right and so the way you can set oh by the way asana and slack are both free they both have paid versions but you can get most of your work done absolutely free using these platforms so back to slack what I recommend you do in setting slack up is create your channels so if you're a social media agency I would probably create a channel for Marketing I would create a channel for connectivity issues I would create a channel for fa Q's just think about and process in your mind what you your team will need and then organize your team in here if you have two people doesn't matter you can grow and scale all within slack by connecting asana and slack and so I'm gonna do a quick search it's called sana slack integration and what that'll do is it'll notify you when do jobs are coming in when changes are made when everything changes within slack so that way you can keep in one platform for most of the day and be able to see all the updates that are happening so you can check that out by going to asana calm forward-slash apps forward slash slack so lastly I'm gonna walk you through kind of this process of how we get things done so for example step one client comes in hey we're doing a website design we need to do a website design project we say ok we gotta prove we get paid and then we get to work so the first thing I'll do is I'll I'll send us a message in project management and I'll say hey CheY please open a job for XYZ she'll say ok so hop into asana or I'm sorry so happened to the Job Description so go to the BA web dev she'll copy this paste it into a sauna alright so advatage will assign it should assign all the subtasks and then she'll send an email to the client saying hey these are the items that we need in the his what we're requesting once they give us that information we store that and we dust expedite the entire onboarding process so once the client comes on all I do is notify Shan she does the rest and then once we're ready to do our brand kickoff call and get started and work on the UI UX I already have an itemized process of due dates and items already laid out ready to go so to recap and I know this is a long winded video I just wanted you guys to get a ton of value basically the way this works is one we get the job we get that into asana that pushes the slack so and get notifications and then we communicate about that job be a slack for the mo for the better part of the job once it's completed we get approval with from the client I meet with the client and then we close it up and we're ready to go to the next month or the next project so guys I hope this was helpful if you have any questions sound off below and we'll talk soon\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: AWS law talks my name is Alex Graham I'm a senior operations engineer on the technical operations team at sac and I've been at slack for a little over a year and a half now and I've watched our infrastructure grow from hundreds of servers to thousands of servers and it's it's really been an amazing experience so I'm sure there's some of you in the audience who are like what's this slack thing and that everyone's talking about and so I guess a messaging app for teams that integrates with dozens of popular tools and services tonight I'm gonna talk a little bit about a project that I worked on it slack where we're using cloud front to accelerate our API but it also gives us the flexibility to apply some security measures at the edge here's what I'm gonna go over first I just want to talk about just to give a general overview of the slack API and I think this will help you understand some of the reasons why we're able to utilize the features of cloud front the next thing I'll talk about is just some of the features that made us interested in cloud front then I'm gonna go into a kind of a technical explanation on how we actually migrated our traffic from a single alb over to cloud front and the next thing I want to go into is just talk about some of the performance benefits that we saw after rolling out cloud front and then the last thing I'll cover is just a few of the things that we have planned as we continue to develop on the cloud front platform as I promised before I dive into the cloud front portion I just want to give a brief overview of our API here's some some examples of our Web API and it's what people think of as a more traditional API and responses our requests are made as get or post requests and all the responses come back as a JSON object so many people have written integrations that utilizes API however all the official slack clients including our web client are also using this API under the hood so that might not be something that you're aware of here's just a few examples of the slack API being used in real world scenarios so in this first example we're using the Search API method and what we're searching for is just a list of all the messages that contain the string hello so what we'd get back here is just a JSON format response that contains a list of our search results and in the second example we're asking for a list of all channels and all the members that belong to those channels using the channels that list method and we'll also get a JSON reform at a response back here and then the last example is just using our channels that create API method and with that we'll just get back a response that's as if it completed successfully or not and that we're creating a channel called test there so as you look at some of these API requests you can see as somebody browses around the slackline you can see how quickly those API requests might add up and this is why we need to make sure that we're delivering those as fast as possible so here's just some stats on our API slack currently has about 3 million daily active users and we're handling about 1.5 billion requests per day to our front ends and just over 50% of those requests our API requests let's talk a little bit about why we ended up deciding on CloudFront there's a lot of CDNs out there and we tested a few of them before we actually decided to go with cloud front these are just some of the benefits that we get with cloud front the project originally started off as us looking for an on-demand DDoS mitigation provider and when I started looking into this I realized that there was a trend that appeared most of these on-demand DDoS mitigation providers were basically just CD ends and they were applying some filtering at the edge to filter out the malicious traffic so I was put into contact with Nate at AWS and he let me know that CloudFront was just already doing a lot of these things automatically and we could probably just leave it enabled all the time and we'd see we'd probably see a performance benefit so we kind of the best of all worlds these are the reasons why we actually ended up going with code front I really liked that cloud front could be fully customized and we could continue using our own slack branded error pages we tested a few providers and we what we did is we compared performance and reliability over about a month and the cloud run beat out the other providers there and reliability was like probably one of the most important things here we're putting a lot of trust in whatever provider we choose here if for some reason that provider has any sort of issue that means our API is gonna have problems too so we need to make sure this is highly available the next thing was just that cloud front paired nicely with some of the existing technologies we are already using so ELB and s3 and this made the migration from yellow beauty cloud front relatively easy let's talk a little bit about how we did that migration this was not or this was a look this can be a little bit of a difficult change to roll out but with using some route some route 53 and DNS magic we were able to pull it off so I just want to take a look at the configuration we have on our cloud front distribution right now caching is totally disabled there's nothing you can really cache on on our API everything is dynamically generated and nothing's really shared between clients we also forward everything back to the origin so all headers cookies query strings etc are all forwarded back to the origin TLB and then the last thing we have set up is just an s3 bucket which contains several htmls static HTML error pages and what this allows us to do is if for some reason the origin ELB is not responding we're still going to display a custom formatted error page and we hope this won't happen too often because if that's happening it means there's a problem and somebody on my team is probably up troubleshooting it this is what we had before we actually moved a cloud front so it's just it's a pretty standard setup we have slack comm pointing to a route 53 alias and then that points to a load elastic load balancer and then we just have a pool of ec2 instances behind that so I'm sure there's a few of you out there who are pretty familiar with this setup it's a pretty common set up and are what we wanted to do is just figure out a way that we could move that traffic over slowly like we didn't want to just flip CloudFront on for everyone and hope for the best so what we did is we actually we wanted to come up with a way to a kind of feature flag it on but our typical pattern is to apply a feature flag inside of the code and then either enable that for some teams or enable that for some percentage of users and we couldn't really do that here because it's such a drastic infrastructure change so what we had to do is do this fly this at the DNS level what we're able to use is the weighted round robin feature of route 53 and what we did is we set slack comm 2.2 records and for one of those records we pointed it at cloud front and for the other we point it directly at the ELB so in this example we have a 1 record pointing at the alb which has a weight of 99 and then we have the second record pointing at cloud front which just has a weight of 1 so what will happen here is 1 in every 100 requests will be sent through cloud front and then 99 and every 100 requests will remain on the EOB so what we did is we just continued incrementing these values while monitoring the graphs and having a few drinks of course and we eventually ended up at a point where we had 100% of our traffic migrated over to cloud front this is the end result of our cloud front rollout and this is the stack that's powering slack today well we just we have a route 53 alias for SATCOM which points to cloud front and then we're forwarding across the AWS network backbone to our ELB in the US east one region where we have a bunch of UC two instances behind it I want to talk a little bit about the performance metrics we collected and we we use a tool called Thousand Eyes and what that is is it's mainly designed to be an always-on constant monitor for your application and we kind of used it in a little bit of a different way here because CD ends are a little bit tricky to benchmark there's there's a lot of factors that come into play and my main goal here was just to make sure that performance was not decreased by adding extra hop because most people will probably assume that you're just adding an extra hop to the to the whole request that's probably gonna decrease performance but we actually found that that wasn't the case this is just a graph of the network latency from about 200 locations around the world and at the top of the graph here that's where we were actually on we're all requests we're going directly back to the ELB and as it starts to ramp down here that's where we started the rollout so you can see that towards the top of the graph we are at about 90 milliseconds of latency for this is average about from 200 locations around the world and then towards the bottom of the graph we ended up at about 15 milliseconds of latency and this is just latency to slack comm so it's basically a ping to slack comm so now it makes sense that we saw this because now we're on cloud front at the edge and all of those distributed nodes means that they're not the client does not have to make many hops before it hits this graph well it may not look as exciting it's actually this is more exciting to me so what we saw here was that the average response time for a simple endpoint on the sack API dropped from about 480 milliseconds down to about 200 milliseconds and this graph is it's scaled a little bit differently but we started the rollout somewhere around here and then towards the end of the roll it's down here and it doesn't look as impressive but up at the top we have 480 milliseconds and then down at the bottom is 45 milliseconds so it's a it's a pretty it's a pretty major jump and what we noticed here was that some of the largest improvements came from clients who were located geographically far away from us east ones such as India China and Australia in these graphs we're taking that same average response time and we're just breaking it down by the various phases of the connection so what we saw here was that the SSL SSL set up time was drafted that's because we move that HTTP termination much closer to the client so we're now able to avoid those long round trips as the client establishes the SSL session we're still using HTTPS from cloud front to the ELB but thanks to connection pooling we're not reestablishing that session for every request so we there's it's kind of a free connection at that point we can also see that the overall response time for this API endpoint dropped from about 488 milliseconds down to 199 milliseconds so while SSL was a huge portion of that we still saw a little bit of benefits from going across the ATF's network backbone and things like that so while this wait time might look like a big piece of the pie it's just because this whole pie only represents 199 milliseconds slack was now about 300 milliseconds faster all around the world and people were really excited about this including one of our founders who threatened to kiss me to death these are just some of the direct benefits that we saw after rolling out cloud front I'm sure many of you are aware there's been a ton of public internet outages lately and there was actually just one the other day on Monday and by using cloud front kind of like a distributed load balancer and getting that end point closer to the clients we're able to avoid some of those internet outages which is really nice every hop that a client needs to make through the public Internet is kind of just a it's a place for something to go wrong so the quicker we can get those clients on to the AWS network the better off we're gonna be in most cases the other really cool thing is that slack really does load more quickly all around the world we we saw in the previous graph we dropped by about 300 milliseconds which was huge and now any API requests or any anything the client was doing that was waiting on an API request now completes much more quickly and you're you're able to see those results when you're like browsing around slack my favorite part is that we don't need to worry about enabling DDoS protection if we experience an attack it will CloudFront will automatically scale and it will automatically handle the attack this is this is great news for me because this was the main goal of the whole project and the performance benefits were just like the icing on the cake as I promised I want to talk a little bit about our future plans we're really just scratching the surface of what can be done with cloud front and we have a lot of plans in mind as we continue to develop on the platform rate limiting so rate limiting is huge since a large majority of our traffic at slack is API calls we have a pretty massive rate limiting infrastructure and what we do right now is we have different rate limits that are applied including per user per team and even per IP rate limits and the way we handle these is just by incrementing counters in memcache so as our traffic grows we also need to grow those memcache clusters so it's it's a little bit of work and what we can do is we can take these rate limits and if we can push them out to the edge that's less infrastructure that we have to maintain and less less resources we're spending undi lling with those requests that we probably don't even care about so the next thing is on authenticated requests and these are a little bit tough to deal with mainly because the only information you really have is whatever comes in on the header of the request so typically these sort of rate limits are IP based and attackers know that on authenticated requests are probably one of the tougher things to deal with so typically when a DDoS attack hap it's going to be against some unauthenticated part of your infrastructure by blocking these at the edge there's much less of a risk that an attack might be able to take our infrastructure offline the next as we work to roll out these changes we want to make sure that we know when these limits are being hit so by alerting and building dashboards and posting this information to slack we'll be able to keep an eye on things and know at a high level what's going on the other really neat thing that we'll be able to do is block malicious traffic right at the edge so if someone does decide to attack slack with a high layer DDoS attack what we can do is we can apply whaff rules to just block that malicious traffic and drop it right at the edge that buys us some time and allows us to figure out what we're gonna do about this attack and by combining a WAF with lambda we also we open up a whole new box of possibilities there we might start blocking traffic from known bad IP ranges by taking like spam lists and botnets and making sure we're just blocking that right at the edge and doing this allows us there's there's really no point in dealing with those battery quests if you already know they're bad if you're letting them into your infrastructure you're just you're wasting resources to deal with them so the other thing we can do is we can use lambda to kind of scan through our logs and then we can apply if we find depending on what rules we set if we find malicious traffic we can block it permanently or temporarily and that's about it thanks for coming out tonight AWS law talks\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: how to use slack for client communication hey guys today i'm going to be showing you how you can set up a client communication portal on slack and how you can set up and optimize your workflow using slack so let's get into it first off you're just going to click on create a new account on slack and you can log in using your google account using your facebook account or just by entering your email here on slack i have already done that and you can see i have two emails linked to slack and i have two different workspaces now i'm just going to open up this little workspace and now you can also download the slack application i do not have that downloaded i find that using slack on my browser is sufficient enough for me but if you are constantly working and you need slack as your basic communication portal i would suggest that you do download the windows application for stack it is also available on ios not ios but on macbooks so you can do that as well now you can see over here this is a empty portal but i am going to click on this over here and i'm going to show you guys how to create a new workspace entirely for your client so this is my slack account i have logged into my marketing portal but what i'm going to do is from the left side over here i'm going to click on add workspaces and i'm going to click on create a new workspace now what i'm going to do is i'm going to enter my email i'm going to continue now i'm going to verify my email once more now this is just the process to create a new workspace this is not a new account it's just a separate workspace that you are going to dedicate to your client now i'm going to enter my confirmation code and now i'm going to launch it in my browser and now over here you can name the company or your team but if this is a entire portal dedicated to your client only you can name it for example if your client is related to your the project name is perfume it's a perfume related project so you could name the company name as a perfume client but for this i'm just going to name it perfume and that is a very odd name but that is what i just thought of after that you are going to add a few portals that you are currently working on any project any specific channels that you want to create so first off i would suggest that you might might as well skip that for now but i'm just gonna add like a chat communication and now you can add your client now you can do this in two ways you can either invite them using gmail or you can get a shareable invite link instead so with a shareable invite link they're going to be able to join the workspace without having to open their gmail account and if you're doing communication on maybe a third-party application and you're not sure about their email yet and you're just communicating via that application you can send them this shareable invite link as well so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just add another account and i'm going to add this teammate and now slack is redirecting me to my workspace now once you do that you can see over here you have direct messaging you can add more people to the specific workspace or you can just customize your workspace as well so for this what you're going to do is first off if you take a look on your left and you click on perfume you're going to have a drop down menu and from here you're going to create different channels and customize your client portal so what you're going to do is you're going to click on preferences and then you can enable your notifications after that you can change the sidebar of your workspace so if you want a file browser any channel browser available you can do that if you want slack connect saved items all that you can add all of that as well after that you have a theme so you can apply a dark theme or a light theme or you can add a color theme that you personally like so you can do that as well depending on your project so maybe if you have a project theme or your client is you know they have like a specific kind of project that has a specific aesthetic you can match the aesthetic of that as well after that you have your messages in media you can customize the general look of everything over here as well then you have accessibility and you can underline links to websites i would suggest that you do turn that on because that is a very essential feature and that helps your client in differentiating specific links from descriptions or anything else and now once you close that these are like your personal kind of settings after that you have your workspace settings now the workspace settings are going to be very important because if you have many people in your company and you're adding a client then you're going to have to enable permissions so what you're going to do is you're going to go into permissions over here and after that you can set who uses a specific channel so let's say workspace owners only can send a message and then you can do a accept guests only so that just depends on what kind of setup you're doing if you're adding your client as a guest then you want to allow guest permissions if you're adding them as a owner you want to allow owner permissions and if you're adding your employees you want owner only permission i would suggest that you add them as a workspace owner and then set your permission to workspace owners only and then by that you're going to enable your client to directly communicate their messages to your employees without having employee disruption or any kind of unnecessary messages that are conveyed to your client for a small business it's very essential that you do keep up a good image so making sure that information is thoroughly conveyed in a good manner is pretty essential you can also now after that you have your invitation so by default any member can invite new people to your workspace you're going to require admin approval and this channel can so all admins can just um approve requests and that just depends on who you set as an administrator then you also have your channel management so who can edit or add the general settings of your slack chat you're gonna make that workspace owners only as well so you can change all of this to workspace owners only then for all of these that are any high-end features you can always make them workspace owners only and make sure that you choose to make this allow editing of any messages or a deletion to be up to never and then you can make it owners and admins only because you don't want anyone else to delete messages between your client and you now after that in your settings you're going to scroll down and you're going to see apps and custom integrations and you're going to manage permissions for apps and integrations as well because having applications and integrations added into your slack is slack chats are very important because if you have a client then you're going to probably be transferring data and information and you need to require app approval so if any member can install and any uninstall any application this might mess up some work so you're going to turn this on and then you're going to allow workspace owners only and then that's around it you don't need to change any other functionalities after that you're going to go back into your slack application with the new settings and then you are going to start adding some channels so first off you're going to have to add a progress channel because that's one of the most essential things that a client is going to need let's say perfume or sales progress so cell to progress and you're going to create it and i'm going to skip this for now after that you're going to create a new channel for maybe marketing strategies yeah this marketing is fine like this now after that you can also make these private so if the marketing team and the sales team is very different they don't have any overlapping people you can make these channels private so it's not accessible to different members of your team who don't really need the access and what this will do is it's going to help your client realize who is working on what and if there is any bottleneck effect in your work they're going to be able to deduct who is um responsible for the bottleneck now after that you're going to also add a channel for your samples any kind of samples that you're doing maybe it's design samples add samples anything like that we're gonna make this like so and then you are going to just if you take your cursor over your channel so this is a samples channel i'm going to do a right click and then you're going to open channel details you're going to click on integrations and you're going to add the app so if it is a app for example if you're doing sample sharing then you're going to click on google drive and you're probably going to install google drive into your slack integration because if you're sharing a lot of data and you're sharing a lot of files you can't really add that many attachments that are that heavy so you're just going to integrate google drive into your slack application and if you do want you can integrate your entire workspace software to your slack and then have a dashboard in your workspace as well for your client but that is something that is reserved for larger and more committed clients and you don't want to do something that requires so much time for something that for a project that might be temporary or that's going to end in a few months now this is generally how you set up a client portfolio for your projects generally speaking this is everything you can do on the free version of slack slack does have a pro and a business version the pro version starts at around 6.67 usd you get unlimited messages archived you get unlimited apps you get group video calls with screen sharing you get work securely with organization using slack connect so i just i'm just going to show you this is slack connect and you can send a direct message to anyone that is even not on slack from another business and then you can even create a channel in which you add a another business entirely so if you're a small business selling perfumes and you're maybe marketing maybe you're hiring someone to do your marketing from new york you can easily create a channel where your companies can work together now after that uh you have a lightweight voice only conversation with slack huddles that's going to allow you some um audio communication without having heavy files after that you have your business plus version which allows you a uptime sla of 99 you also get a single sign on you get data exports for all your messages and all your messages are archived and saved permanently so that is generally the overall functionality of slack i hope you guys found this video helpful and you're now able to set up your own client on slack and get your team set up here as well and i will catch you guys in the next video\n",

시간에는 보다 이러한 앱을 더 확장에서 책보 옷을 만들어 보는 시간을 가져보도록 할게요 이 슬랙 책 보시라고 하는 것은 사용자가 이 슬랙 벗에게 말을 걸었을 때 그에 대한 적절한 응답을 수행하는 앱 을 의미합니다 그래서 슬랙 착 봇을 구현하고자 한다면 사용자가 착 봇을 부르는 과정을 이벤트로 받아들여서 스낵 착 보시 동작하도록 해야되요 따라서 이전 시간에 이어서 이 슬랙 책 봇을 한 번 이어서 구현해 보도록 하겠습니다 가장 먼저 마찬가지로 이 api 이 사이트로 이동을 해 주시구요 우리가 지난 시간까지 작업을 했던 이 앱의 한 번 들어가 보도록 할게요 이제 기본적으로 사용자가 이러한 슬랩 봇을 맨손 을 하는 등으로 불렀을 때 이 책 보시 그러한 사용자가 말을 거는 것을 이벤트로서 받아들이기 위해서는 이벤트 설정을 해주셔야 되어 보시면 이벤트 구독 이라고 이벤트 섭스크립션 페이지가 있는 걸 확인 할 수 있는데요 이제 여기에서 이 버튼을 눌러서 온 으로 설정을 해 주셔야지 사용자가 이러한 슬랩 곳을 부르는 그러한 다양한 이벤트를 감지할 수가 있습니다 이제 아래쪽으로 내려가 보시면요 실제로 구독을 할 특정 이벤트에 대해서 설정할 수가 있는데요 저는 바로 한번 여기에서 m 멘션을 넣어 보도록 할게요 다시 말해서 해당 슬랩 107 이렇게 이 슬랙 컬 스터디를 이런식으로 불렀을 때 이것을 이벤트로 감지하게 따는 거예요 지금 멘션을 이벤트로 감시하도록 설정할 수가 있는 겁니다 실제로 이러한 이벤트가 발생했을 때는 우리의 파이썬 서버 로 요청을 보내게 되는데요 이제 이것은 슬랙 api 가 수행을 하는 겁니다 다시 말해서 이렇게 사용자가 있다고 있을 때 우리 사용자는 슬랙 에 들어가서 우리의 슬랙 앱을 부를 수가 있겠죠 그러면은 이 앱을 불렀다는 이러한 이벤트가 발생하게 되는 이벤트는 우리 컴퓨터에 있는 파이썬 서버에게 리퀘스트를 보내는 거예요 현재 이벤트가 발생해 쓰니까 어떻게 응답을 하면 좋을까요 이런식으로 리퀘스트 가옥의 되고 그럼 이제 서버는 그에 대한 정답을 즉 240 자한테 어떠한 메시지를 보내라 등과 같은 그러한 이벤트에 대한 처리 내용을 응답으로 바람 할 수가 있는 겁니다 그럼 결과적으로 이런 인덕 값을 토대로 해서 실제로 슬랙 앱이 다시 사용자 한테 어떠한 메세지를 출력해 주는 거예요 바로 이게 책 보세 동작 과정이라고 할 수 있습니다 그렇다면은 다시 말해서 슬랩 입장에서는 자신이 낸 셤 이 되었을 때 즉 자신의 불려 졌을 때 우리의 서버로 리퀘스트를 보내 겠죠 즉 우리의 서버 주소가 바로 여기에 들어가는 되는 겁니다 바로 한번 여기에서 코딩을 해서 실제로 그러한 요청을 처리하는 과정을 담아 보도록 할게요 일반적으로 요청 데이터는 제이슨 데이터로 들어오니까 일을 처리할 수 있도록 제이슨을 리포트 해주고요 그 다음에 우리는 슬랙 에 입사하여 통신하기 위해서 서버를 만들어 되는데 그 서버를 간단하게 이 플라스크를 이용해서 만들어 보도록 할게요 플라스크를 검색해서 추가하시면 됩니다 그러면은 플라스크 로 우리가 일종의 웹서버를 간단하게 개발할 수가 있는 거고요 자 플라스크 리퀘스트 그리고 메이크 리스폰스 라는 라이브러리를 임포트 할 수 있도록 할게요 자 지난 시간에 작성했던 이 슬랙 커 객체를 만드는 부분은 그대로 내버려 줄게요 이제 간단하게 바로 플라스크를 이용해서 플라스크 서버를 구동시킬 수 가 있는데요 이렇게 오타 또한 잘 잡아 주시구요 한번 간단하게 테스트 목적으로 웹서버를 구동 시켜 보도록 할게요 우리 서버 에 기본 경로로 들어왔을 때는 또 들어올 때 객 방울씩 곡 은 호스트 방식으로 접속을 했을 때는 인덱스 페이지를 보여줄 수 있도록 만들어 볼게요 이렇게 헬로 월드 라고 출력하도록 하면 됩니다 이제 이어서 매일 함수를 작성하시면 됩니다 메인 함수에서 앱 점 런 이라고 해서 자 우리의 로컬 주소에서 8080 포트로 서버를 구동시킬 수 있도록 한번 해볼게요 이제 한번 실행을 해보시면 요 성공적으로 이 플라스크 웹서버가 동작하는 걸 확인할 수 있구요 바로 한번 이렇게 로코 로스트 에서 8080 포트로 접속을 해보시면 헬로 월드 라고 주력하는 걸 확인할 수 있습니다 이제 여기에서 슬랙 api 같은 경우는 어떠한 01 ip 를 이용하는 url 에 접속을 하는 식으로 동작을 해요 그렇기 때문에 현재 우리는 간단하게 우리 컴퓨터 내에서만 서버 를 구동시키고 있기 때문에 전 세계 어디에서나 우리의 웹 서버에 접속하도록 하고 싶다면 공인 주소를 가지도록 만들어야 되요 이때 가장 간단한 것은 n 그룹입니다 엥 그 록 을 이용하면 간단히 공인 주얼 4 를 사용할 수 있는데요 엥 그룹이 설치되어 있지 않으신 분들은 먼저 노드 js 를 설치 하셔야 되구요 노드 js 가 설치된 이후에는 자동으로 mpm 이 깔리게 되는 데요 mpm 을 이용해서 n 그룹을 설치하시면 되는거예요 우리는 이제 이러한 과정이 닿아 이루어졌다고 가정하고 바로 한번 n 그룹 을 이용해 보도록 할게요 바로 명령프롬프트 에서 l 그룹 을 실행해 보도록 하겠습니다 자행 그룹 을 이용해서 우리의 http 즉 8분 포트로 들어오는 데이터를 우리 로컬 컴퓨터에 8080 포트로 이런식으로 터널링을 진행하도록 만들면 되요 그럼 이제 이렇게 공인 주 아이엘 주석과 나온 걸 확인할 수 있습니다 이제 이 주소로 접속을 해보시면 요 누구나 이 주소로 접속을 하게 되면 은 우리 컴퓨터에 있는 플라스크 웹 서버에 접속할 수가 있게 되는 겁니다 이제 이것을 슬랙 보세요 청주 연료로 사용하면 되겠죠 따라서 이제 실제로 착 봇을 구현해 보도록 할게요 자 이제 일단 서버 로 정해 시켜 주시구요 자 사용자 한테 자 사용자 한테 응답 하고자 하는 그런 내용을 갠 써 라고 해서 응답할 수 있도록 만들게요 안녕하세요 라는 문장을 우리 슬랙 사용자 한테 우리 책 보시 응답하도록 만들게요 그리고 이제 실제로 슬랙 api 가 우리 웹 서버에 접속할 때는 요 특정한 경우로 로 접속을 하도록 만들어야 겠죠 저는 한번 이 슬랙 이라는 경로로 접속하도록 만들게요 갭 방식 혹은 포스트 방식으로 접속을 했을때 응답할 수 있도록 처리해 보겠습니다 잘 기본적으로 슬랙 api 는 재미있은 형태로 우리 서버에 데이터를 보내주는 데요 이 데이터를 닫아서 먼저 챌린지 에 대한 내용을 처리 해야 되요 기본적으로 이 슬랙 api 같은 경우는 먼저 우리 서버가 정상적으로 동작하는지 확인하기 위해서 이 챌린지 라는 이벤트를 먼저 보내게 됩니다 그래서 그 이벤트가 들어왔을 때는 그 채 렌지 갚을 그대로 다시 슬랙 한테 보내줄 수 있도록 하면 되요 또한 데이터를 보낼 때는 컨텐트 타입 으로 어플리케이션 제이슨 이라고 지칭 하시면 됩니다 또한 이렇게 매스 5 치라고 잘 넣어주시면 되구요 이제 한번 다시 서버를 구동 시켜 보도록 할게요 그럼 이렇게 성공적으로 서버가 구동되는 걸 확인할 수 있구요 이제 우리는 기존의 웹 서버에서 이렇게 슬랙 이라는 경로로 슬랙 api 를 처리할 수 있도록 만들었으니까요 이 경로를 그대로 이벤트 섭스크립션 에 리퀘스트 14일로 넣으시면 됩니다 이렇게 넣어주시면 은 자동으로 베리 파인이 수행 되고요 성공적으로 베리 파이드 라고 해서 우리 서버가 정상적으로 동작하고 있다는 것을 검증한 것을 확인할 수 있습니다 이제 이렇게 세이브 체인지 x 버튼을 눌러서 앤 멘션이 발생했을 때 성공적으로 우리의 개인 웹 서버로 해당 내용을 보내도록 처리한 것을 확인할 수 있습니다 이제 실제로 체포 슬 구동 시키도록 할게요 이 챌린지 같은 경우에는 기본적으로 우리의 웹 서버가 정상적으로 슬랙 api 를 처리할 수 있는지에 대해서 / 검지가 4 목적으로 사용하는 거구요 이제 실제로 이벤트 같은 경우는 바로 이런 식으로 처리할 수 있습니다 이벤트라는 같이 존재하는 경우 이벤트 타입을 확인해야 겠죠 실제로 이벤트 타입 같은경우는 우리는 m 멘션 이라고 설정을 했었어 그래서 타입 같은 경우는 앤 맨션 있겠죠 그래서 이제 이 벤텐 들어라 함수를 만들어서 이 타입을 보내줄 겁니다 이 타입의 보내서 핸들이 가능하도록 처리를 할 겁니다 그다음 만약에 이벤트가 존재하지 않았을 때는 관련 오류를 띄울 수 있도록 하기 위해서 슬랭 요청에 이벤트가 없습니다 라고 이렇게 404 오류를 띄울 수 있도록 만들면 될 거에요 그다음 이렇게 x 순례의 놀이 트라이 라고 해서 값으로 이를 넣어주시면 됩니다 그럼 이제 이벤트 핸들러 함수를 실제로 만들어 주면 되겠죠 이제 바로 이벤트 핸들러를 만들어 보겠습니다 자 이벤트 타입 부어 이벤트에 대한 배움이다 들어왔을 때 우리는 이제 이벤트 타입이 에 멘션 일때만 처리하면 될 겁니다 그래서 먼저 우리의 슬랙 앱을 굴은 위치를 가져오도록 할게요 찬양 값에 다가 담으셔서 가지고요 이제 상자 한테 응가 팍 오지 않은 그 텍스트를 받아와서 실제로 우리 슬랙 컬 라이브러리를 이용해서 메세지를 해당 채널에서 보내줄 수 있도록 하면 되겠죠 그 다음에 이제 슬랩 풀 게다가 실제로 앤 맨션 메시지가 본 외적 딸고 알려주면 될겁니다 그 다음에 만나게 오류가 발생하는 경우에는 이벤트 핸들러를 찾을 수 없습니다 라고 이렇게 하나의 문자를 만들어서 그것을 반환 할 수 있도록 만들면 예 처리까지 깔끔하게 끝냈다 고 할 수 있는 겁니다 이렇게까지 만들어주시면 은 결과적으로 개 댄스 함수 이벤 템들 남수 쉬울 3 술까지 다 만들어 져서 슬랙 apa 가 보내는 이벤트를 적절하게 처리할 수 있게 된겁니다 이제 한 번 다시 서버 를 구동시켜 서 확인해보도록 할게요 이렇게 현재의 서브 가 정상적으로 구동이 되고 있는 상태구요 바로 한번 랜덤 채널에서 우리의 슬랩 벗을 불러 보도록 할게요 이렇게 불러서 안녕이라고 한번 메시지를 보내 보겠습니다 그럼 이렇게 현재 우리의 술래 갭이 해당 채널의 초대가 안되어 있다고 하죠 그러면 초기 하시면 됩니다 초대 하시는 바로 우리의 슬랙 앱이 초대가 된 걸 확인할 수 있구요 자 다시 한번 위에 술래 갭을 불러 보도록 할게요 그랬더니 반응이 없죠 이럴 때는 가장 먼저 현재 우리 서버가 정상적으로 동작하고 있는지를 체크 하셔야 되요 다시한번 베리 파이 를 수행해 보도록 할게요 다행히 서버는 잘 동작하는 것 같구요 그런데도 불구하고 동작하지 않는 경우에는 다시 이렇게 토큰 값을 확인해 보는 것이 중요합니다 이토 끙 값이 정상적으로 들어가 있는지를 확인을 하셔야 되어 다시 이렇게 잘 붙여 넣기를 해볼게요 이것 또한 문제가 없네요 또한 이럴 때는 형제 서버가 여러 번 실행 중이지 는 않은지 체크를 하셔야 되요 지금 보시면 전 이렇게 서버 프로그램이 동시에 2개의 실행되고 있었네요 따라서 이렇게 다종교 시켜 주었구요 다시한번 서버를 구동 시켜 보도록 할게요 이제 이 상태에서 다시 우리 슬랙 봇을 불러 보도록 하겠습니다 그럼 이렇게 슬랙 벗을 불렀을 때 바로 이 콘솔 창을 확인해 보시면 은 오류가 발생했다면 그 5를 내용을 확인할 수가 있습니다 자 확인을 해보니 까요 제가 슬랙 함수를 잘 못 넣었어요 예 포스트 메세지를 넣으셔야 되는데 제가 실수로 퍼스트 를 넣었네요 이렇게 한 다음에 다시 서버 를 구동시켜 보시면은 이제 정상적으로 동작을 할 겁니다 자 다시 한번 슬랙 스터디를 불러 보도록 할게요 이렇게 불러 보니까 이번에는 정상적으로 우리의 슬랙 앱이 안녕하세요 라고 출력하는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다 집 특정한 사용자가 이 퍼즐을 불렀을 때 이렇게 봇은 부르는 것에 대한 정보를 우리 웹서버가 인식을 해서 그에 대한 적절한 응답을 보내주는 것을 확인할 수 있고 바로 이런 식으로 책 봇을 직접 개발할 수가 있는 겁니다 그렇지 우리가 이렇게 특정한 슬랙 것을 불렀을 때 우리가 이렇게 이벤트 구독 페이지에서 슬랙 앱 을 불렀을 때의 대한 이벤트를 감지 하도록 설정을 했기 때문에 이렇게 우리의 갠 웹서버로 해당 정보가 날라와서 우리는 우리 웹서버에서 안녕하세요 라고 응답을 하도록 만들어 짜 나요 이렇게 포스트 msg 함수를 이용해서 응답하도록 만들었으니까 결과적으로 그에 대한 정보가 다시 이 슬랙 쪽으로 넘어가서 결과적으로 슬랙 앱이 안녕하세요 라고 우리가 의도한 대로 응답한 것을 확인할 수가 있는 겁니다 바로 이런 식으로 우리는 자유롭게 슬랙 책 봇을 구현해서 우리만의 즉 우리의 회사 에서 사용될 수 있는 그러한 목적에 맞게 자유롭게 슬랙 앱을 개발해서 사용할 수가 있는 겁니다 이상으로 에서 실제로 파이썬을 활용해서 슬랙 찾 꽃까지 만들어보는 시간을 가져보았습니다\n",

포스 어떤 회상 입니다 업무용 메신저 수에 카카오 보다도 낮다 세이즈 포스의 왜 슬랭 을 원하는가 직격탄을 맞은 건 구글의 팀 마이크로소프트 역시 긴장 이렇게 이야기를 시작할 거구요 자 시작하기 전에 1 달 좋아요 부터 누르고 시작하겠습니다 자구 독도 많이 해주세요 센스 포스는 바로 클라우드 플랫폼 입니다 이제 클라우드 플랫폼 이라는 컬러와도 회사는 미인

일까요 슬랙 은 업무용 메신저 라고 아까 살짝 말씀을 드렸습니다 이제 업무용 메신저 가다 비스타 잖아요 메신저는 그렇기 때문에 실내기 장점만 관해서 한번 이야기를 해보겠습니다 이 출처는 진 민규의 마케팅이야기 택 이야기해서 2분이 카카오톡 보다 좋은 이유를 굉장히 잘 설명을 해주셨어요 밑에 이제 설명 보시면은 거기에다가 제가 추천을 덧글로 다녀도 도록 하겠습니다 실내는 기업용 메신저 로 이 타인이 스타일이라는 게임 회사에서 내부 커뮤니케이션을 위해 만들었는데 이제 슬 이콘 밸리에서 엄청나고 온 어때요 그래서 이 회사는 아예 게임 개발을 적고 본업을 접고 달리 부업을 그냥 만든건데 본업이 삼게 된거죠 되게 대박 잊어 그쵸 특히 무릎 오전으로 가입해도 인원수와 기능 제한없이 사용할 수 있다는데요 이제 큰데 저장 공간과 검색 까는 메세지의 는 제안이 있다고 합니다 기업용 유료 버전의 가입하면 은 좀 더 다양한 혜택과 서비스가 제공된다고 합니다 이게 바로 그들의 빚이 있을 모델이 되겠죠 그래서 술래 근 어떤 잠이 더 좋을까 우리 카톡도 상당히 좋은데 말이죠 그쵸 모바일 알림 설정 기능을 아래 월 5가지의 세분화 했다고 합니다 뭐 이렇게 5가지 읽어 볼게요 해당 채널의 모든 데요 나의 id 를 언급할 경우 요거는 되게 좋은 것 같아요 그 다음에 사전에 지정이 될 중요 단어를 언급할 경우 그 처제가 해야되는 일이 들어가면 은 그 단어만 해도 뜨는 것보다 괜찮 초 일대의 멧세지 r 가장 중요한 거 알림을 끌 수 있다 그쵸 이렇게 5가지 겨울옷 아다 세분화가 된다고 합니다 이제 더 자세히 보면은 내가 원하는 내용만 알림을 받을 수 있다고 합니다 저희가 이게 그 가장 저도 그렇고 카톡을 사용했을때 아니면 다른 매체인 카톡이 그래도 다른 메신저 보다 더 나은 것 같은데 그 단톡방 에 알림을 거 버리자 나요 그러면 또 중요한 정보는 못 보게 되고 나중에 빨간색으로 숫자가 56 씩 빡 올라가면 은 약간 짜증이 나고 교 타고 단톡방 이 알림을 켠 오찬이 무음으로 켠 오찬이 이 징징거리고 어 뭐지 그 좀 짜증나는 경험을 다 해보셨을 거예요 그런데 어 원하는 내용만 알림을 받을 수 있다 이게 가장 큰 것 같네요 그 다음에 정보 보호와 개개인의 대화가 아니기 때문에 기업의 업무용 이 라면은 보안이 제일 중요하죠 우리 카톡방 애초에 기업용 이 아니라서 보완을 기대하기가 어렵다고 합니다 어 한편 슬랙 은 해외에 서버를 둔 메신저 라 역설적으로 이 보완을 정부나 기간 요청에서 자유롭고 otp 를 통한 보현 을 제공하고 있어서 안전하다고 합니다 그 다음에 검색에 용이성 인데요 참 이게 조금 자료가 2002 분이 스크 이 글을 쓰신 게 2016년 도 인가 그래요 이미 4년 전 이잖아요 그래서 카톡도 많이 진행을 하고 저는 파통 에 대해서 만족할 수도 있기 때문에 많이 달라졌을 수 있습니다 자 이제 음 대화 내용을 찾기가 쉽다 는 겁니다 승리의 에서는 정말 검색 기능이 끼어 난다고 합니다 그래서 예를 들어서 ceo 에 id 로 검색을 하면 부여의 필요할까요 vip 로 검색하면 은 그가 공개 채널에서 나는 대화 내용을 누구든지 바로 찾아서 볼 수 있다고 합니다 그 다음에 쉽게 다른 직원을 찾아 대화가 가능하다고 해요 이제 보통 우리가 카톡에서 누군가와 대화를 하려면 기본적으로 전화 번호를 저장하거나 카톡 아이디가 알아야죠 하지만 기업 전체가 슬러 베 가입한 경우는 다른 직원의 이름 만으로 쉽게 찾아서 대화를 할 수가 있다고 합니다 그다음 요기 다섯 번째가 아마 굉장히 좋은 장점 같아요 이것 때문에 이게 나중에도 나오기 때문에 요거를 꼭 기억하셔서 쓰면 합니다 기존 업무용 솔루션과 연계가 돼서 9 이트라이브 드랍박스 이런 그 클라우드 데이터 와 연결이 돼 가지고 그 활용하는 앱들이 수매가 쉽게 연동이 되어 데이터를 주고 받을 수 있고 알림도 수 맥에서 받들 수 있다는 거죠 그래서 데이터를 쉽게 주고 받을 수 있고 이 알림은 실내에서 받을 수 있다는 것들이 바로 회사에서 사용할 수 있는 가장 큰 장점이 아닐까 라고 추측을 해봅니다 그렇다면 세이즈 푸스 왜 신뢰를 원하는 걸까요 세일즈 포스는 최근 몇년 동안 화이바 할 mna 를 해왔습니다 mnl 을 통해서 이제 회사를 확장하고 공격적으로 확장해서 키우는 회사인 거죠 이제 얼마 전에 데이터 분석 소프트웨어를 만드는 탭으로 소프트웨어 2019년 약 160억 달러 가격이 크네요 160억 달러에 인수했고 1년 전에는 네트워크 소프트 업체 뮬 소프트를 65억 달러에 인수를 했습니다 그리고 실레 근 지금 현 퇴 통한 나왔다는 거예요 협상하기 로 사인을 하지는 않았습니다 결 10이 될 수도 있어요 이건 아무도 모르는 거죠 근데 이게 발표 1 전야 막 긍정적으로 하겠죠 업계에서 가장 큰 소프트웨어 거래 중 하나가 될 것이라고 예상을 합니다 그 이유는 근거는 2019년 ibm 에 일에 대해 꼬매기 340억 달러 2016년 마이크로소프트가 위크 딘을 구매한게 270억 어 2014년 페이스북이 와 최 부 구매 안개 팩 90억 인데요 이 것보다도 아마 크지 않을까 라고 어 생각을 하거나 요사이 에 들어간다는 뜻이겠죠 자외 드 붓이 증권의 대나 이브스 가는 사람은 cmb 씨와의 인터뷰에서 내 아내요 이게 싸이 플스 창업자 젊 클라우드 에 관한 지출이 기업 전체의 확산됨에 따라 그 예전에는 큰 나오더라는 게 없었잖아요 그랬는데 이제 기업들이 전부다 클로드 에 관한 지출을 하기 시작한 거죠 이것을 왜 그러죠 이번에 있었던 펜 데미 때문에 재택 근무를 해야지 되기 때문입니다 재택근무를 해야지 되기 때문에 관리와 유지가 더 쉬운 클라우드의 걸로 이제 모든 정보들을 지출하는 추세가 되고 있는 거죠 그렇기 때문에 협업 엔진과 제품 설치 공간을 더욱 구축하는 것은 게임 판도를 바꿀 수 있다 그럼 에는 센스 paul's 가 이 클라우드 업체 였다면 은 이 부분은 어떻게 해석을 좋으시면 주니 하면은 이 스낵을 인수하면서 조금 다른 부분 조금 더 소프트한 부분을 건드려 줄 수 있다는 거죠 그래서 아까 보시면은 국외 드라이브나 드랍박스 를 통해서 쉽게 데이터를 주고받을 수 있겠다고 있잖아요 순례기 근데 여기서는 그런 구글드라이브 나 드랍박스 보다 이제 쎈스 포스를 이용해서 그 주고받을 수 있게 하겠죠 그럼 당연히 세이즈 폴스 이용자가 드러나게 되겠죠 그리고 이 메신저 도 하면서 하는 거니까 는 좀더 이 제품 간의 끈끈한 사람들이 그 스낵과 세즈 포쓰 생태계의 들어가면 은 이 끈끈하게 연결이 되어서 그 부족함이 없어서 그 생태 게 안에서 잘 머물 수 있게 해주는 역할을 해줄 것이라고 기대를 하고 그것이 바로 께 체인저 가 될 수 있을 것이라고 기대를 한다는 뜻입니다 그럼 직격탄을 맞는 것은 9급의 팀이라고 합니다 자 데미 lives 웨브 시 이 증권사 항로가 이제 세이즈 포스가 지난해 157억 의사들이 데이터 분석 업체 탭으로 와 함께 슬랙 을 인수하게 되면 세이즈 포스는 새롭게 떠오르는 강력한 풀리 폰 경쟁자가 될 것이라고 말했습니다 좀 토마스 드 쿨이 n 구글 클라우드 ceo 는 지난 1년 동안 사업 성장에 있어 계속 약속을 해 왔고 그 약속 가능한 일을 해왔습니다 하지만 여전히 마이크로소프트 나 a 더블 아마존 웹 서비스 줘 아마 좋은 보다는 뒤쳐져 있다고 생각한다 고 i've 스는 말했습니다 아마 좀 마이크로 쓰 구글의 코너 드 사업자에 대한 비교는 각각 서로 다른 방식으로 보고하기 때문에 비교가 불가능하지만 구글은 삶 이라는 평가가 집에 적 이라고 합니다 아마 종일 마이크로소프트가 이구리 3 인가봐요 세이즈 포스 다신 내 베 인수하게 될 경우 본질적으로 다른 경쟁자를 더 직접적으로 싸움에 투입하게 되는 것이라고 이 아이 부스는 말합니다 그쵸 수맥이 가지고 있는 특징들 아까울 얘기했지만 메신저 안에서 이제 그 저장되어 있는 클럽의 데에 타 에 저장돼 있는 그 데이터들을 서로 주고 받는 기능은 그러면서 책등 까지 가게 한 울기는 들 그럼 본질적으로 다른 부분들을 싸움에 투입하게 되는 거죠 그래서 요런 발표가 나자마자 이게 처음에 요 저 버지 어 crs 포스가 그 수학을 인수할 수도 있다는게 월 17 저널의 가장 최초로 났었다 고 해요 아마 요 때쯤에 난 것 같아요 10:00 요금 방 했어요 그래서 구글의 주가가 이때 바로 조금 하러 글 했었습니다 물론 종가는 꼭 보합 으로 끝났기 는 했습니다 그다음 역시 마이크로소프트 역시 긴장을 해야 된다고 합니다 아까 마이크로소프트가 2위 여 썼죠 마이크로소프트는 이미 소프트웨어 분야에서 쎄 쎄 쎄 쎄 쎄 쎄 쎄 쎄 쎄 쎄 경쟁을 하고 있습니다 2016년 테크크런치 는 마이크로소프트가 수맥을 최대 60 80억 달러에 사들이는 것을 이미 2016년에 검토를 했지만 어떤 거래도 성사되지 않았다고 보도했습니다 그래서 그의 말에 마이크로소프트는 팀 커뮤니케이션 앱을 도입은 했습니다 스맥 은 2019년 상장 을 추진하면서 구식 쩝 우리 회사의 의 1차 경쟁 서는 마이크로소프트 코퍼레이션 이라고 말했다 고 합니다 마이크로소프트는 이제 큰 팀 애기 줄 수 있는 큰 고객 기반을 가지고 있었죠 센 스 프 스 도 이미 고객층이 있기 때문에 순액 에게 비슷한 혜택을 줄 수 있을 거라고 생각을 한다고 합니다 승 맥은 지난 2019년 10월 1년 전이네요 어 하루에 천 200만명의 활성산소의 공자가 있다고 밝혔습니다 그해 10월에는 어 마이크로소프트 등 팀이 매일 1억 1천 500만명 의 활동적인 사용자가 있다고 확보를 했다고 밝혔습니다 10배 차이가 나는 거죠 그러면은 이거는 거 꿀로 말라면 이제 슬랙 또 마이크로소프트처럼 1 성장을 가능성이 이 터는 이야기가 된거죠 마이크로소프트 난 구글 같은 경우는 지금 거의 성장이 많이 된 최대한 텐 이미 뭐 추한 성숙한 기업이 잖아요 그래서 더 이상 이러니 활성 사용자 어플 같은거 에지 채팅어플 의 메신저 어플의 활성 자 이제 더 큰 성장이 있을 것이라고 보고 있지는 않은데 실내 근 이제 시작하는 회사 이니까 더 큰 성장을 할 수 있을 것이라고 기대 하는 듯 합니다 자 개인적인 추가적인 공부는 필수 이고요 오늘 영상도 도움이 되셨기를 바라고 다음 영상에서 다시 뵙겠습니다 감사합니다\n",

툴인 슬랙의 한 고급 기능인데요 간단하게 설명드리면 코딩 없이 일종의 슬랙 봇을 만드는 방법이라고 설명드릴 수 있을 것 같습니다 어 이제 개발을 해서 슬랙 봇을 만들어서 뭐 팀의 업무 생산성을 늘리는 그런 사례들은 좀 들어 보셨을 텐데요 슬 워크플로우는 기능을 활용하면 코딩을 할 줄 몰라도 우리 그 회사에 맞게 어 자동으로 동작하는 슬랙 봇을 만들 수 있고 그걸 우리 회사 업무 프로세스 안에 적용시킬 수 있습니다 다만 이제 슬랙 워크플로우는 슬랙의 유료 계정을 쓰는 어 팀 그 계정에 한해만 쓸 수 있다는 점은 미리 말씀드리겠습니다 어 제가 진행하고 있는 노코드 강의에서 한 분께서 어 자기 회사에서 일을 적용해서 어 운영을 해 보니까 행정적인 처리 분면에서 굉장히 효율적이고 구성원들 호응이 높다고 해서 제가 저 처음 슬 워크플로우는 기능을 알게 됐고요 살펴보니까 굉장히 유용하고 어 다양한 회사에서 그 적용해 볼 만한 기능인 거 같아서 여러분들께 소개시켜 드리게 됐습니다이 자리를 빌어서 슬 워크플로우를 소개시켜 주신 안서현님께 감사의 말씀 전하겠습니다 자 그럼 오늘 할 일에 대해서 구체적으로 말씀드려 보겠습니다 오늘 할리는 슬랙 워크플로우와 제피와 에어테이블을 연동해서 한 회사의 연차를 관리 리하는 걸 해보겠습니다 어 구성해 보고자 하는 시나리오는 어 사용자 입장에서 그러니까 일반 구성원 입장에서 슬랙을 떠나지 않고 슬한 채널에서 연차를 등록한다는 거를 이제 입력을 하면 어 자동으로 연차가 등록이 되고 그 자녀 연차 내역에 반영이 돼 가지고 그 연차를 관리하는 내부 어드민 툴에서 그 우리 회사 전체의 연차 현황을 일몽 요연하게 관리할 수 있는 것까지를 자동화하는 걸 해보겠습니다 어 연차 관리의 경우에는 뭐 그룹웨어를 쓸 수도 있고 그리고 HR 솔루션을 쓰실 수도 있고요 그리고 제가 구현하려고 하는 시나리오를 어 구글 설문이나 타입폼 같은 폼 툴을 이용해서 구현하실 수 있는데요 제가 슬랙 워크플로우가 굉장히 유용하다고 느꼈던 부분은 어 슬랙을 사용하고 있는 팀을 전제했을 때 어 우리가 일하면서 슬랙을 또 띄워 놓고 일하게 되잖아요 근데 그 슬랙 창 안에서 연차 신청 확인 그리고 전체 시스템에 반 용되는 것까지 컨텍스트 스위칭 없이 모든 업무를 처리할 수 있다는 점에서 굉장히 유용하다고 느꼈고 그래서이 시스템을 어 벤치마크 해서 우리 회사에 적용했을 때도 회사 구성원들이 슬랙을 쓰고 있는 어떤 그런 상황이라면 그런 스타트업 기업이라면 굉장히 쉽게 구성원들이이 시스템에 적응할 수 있을 것 같고 다른 그룹 에어나 다른 툴로 연동하는 것보다 굉장히 편하게 구현할 수 있는 방법인 거 같아 가지고 슬래 워크플로우를 가지고 그 연차 관리를 자동화하는 걸 보여드리 드리기로 했습니다 연차 관리 자동화 말고 다양한 기능들을 슬 워크플로우를 통해 자동화할 수 있을 것 같은데요 그건 추후에 제가 다른 영상으로 계속 유스케이스를 한번 소개 들켜 드려 볼 수 있도록 해보겠습니다 거드 절미하고 연차 관리를 그럼 스택 어 워크플로우를 적용했을 때 어떻게 되는지 바 바로 보여 드리겠습니다 자 제가 일단 세팅해 놓은 어 슬렉 채널입니다이 휴가 테스트라는 채널에서이 쇼커 버튼을 누르면 제가 미리 등록해 놓은 연차 등록이라는 워크플로우가 있습니다 이 워크플로를 선택하게 되면 이런 폼이 나오게 되고요 이걸 이렇게 선택을 해서 사용자가 어 자신의 추가 정보를 이렇게 등록을 하게 됩니다 12월 1일부터 뭐 12월 2일까지 이틀 동안의 어 어 그 휴가를 등록하는 걸 한번 해보겠습니다 그래서 이렇게 휴가를 등록하게 되면이 채널에 어 정상적으로 휴가가 등록됐다는게 바로 피드백이 오게 되고요 이걸 관리하는 그 에어 테이블에도 이렇게 휴가 신청 내 에 들어오게 되고이 에어 테이블을 다시 구성원 별로 볼 수 있게 정리해 놓은 테이블을 어 제가 세팅을 해 놨는데이 구성원별로 볼 수 있는 화면에서도 이틀짜리 연차가 사용이 돼서 총 16일 연차 중에서 14일의 자녀 연차가 남았다는 것까지 이제 바로 자동화 돼서 어 시스템에 반영된 걸 보실 수 있습니다 자 그러면이 시스템을 어떻게 그 구현했는지 한번 보여 드려 보겠습니다 먼저 어 슬랙 워크플로우를 어떻게 세팅하는 보여 드릴게요 슬랙 워크플로우의 경 경우에는 요렇게 워크플로우 빌더는 걸 통해서 세팅할 수 있습니다 그래서 워크플로우 빌더를 이렇게 오픈하게 되면 뭐 우리 회사의 워크플로우를 이렇게 만들 수 만들 수 있는데요 제가 한번 연차 등록하는 워크플로우를 만들어 보겠습니다 이렇게 이름을 정해 주고 어떤 상황에이 워크플로우를 쓸 거냐 이걸 묻는게 나오는데 제가 아까 보여 드렸던 것처럼 사용자가 쇼크업 버튼을 눌러서 워크플로우를 어 진행할 수 있게 할 수도 있고요 아니면은 특정 채널에 새로운 멤버가 들어왔을 경우에나 이모지 리액션이 있을 경우에나 아니면 정해진 시간과 날짜에도 워크플로우가 동작하도록 세팅할 수도 있습니다 굉장히 다양한 시나리오에서 워크플로우를 가지고 어 우리 회사의 그 루틴한 업무들을 자동화할 수 있을 것 같죠 다양한 시나리오는 또 소개 다른 영상에서 소개시켜 드리는 걸로 하고요 오늘은 이제 숏컷을 가지고 자동화 해 보겠습니다 어느 채널에서 자동화 할지를 정해주고 숏컷의 이름을 이렇게 정해줬습니다 그러면 해당 채널에서 숏컷 버튼을 눌렀을 때 워크플로우가 동작하기 시작하는데요 그다음에 이제 어떤 업무를 처리해 줄지는 제피어 럼 이렇게 쭉 그 플로우를 정의해 주시기만 하면 됩니다 어 제가 아까 보여 드렸던 시나리오에서는 그 구성원의 폼 입력을 먼저 받아야겠죠 그래서 연차 등록 양식이라는 폼을 만들고 뭐 이렇게 문항들을 구성해 주시면 됩니다 그래서 연차 종류로 이렇게 드롭다운 리스트로 만들어 볼 거고 각 회사마다 뭐 연차를 운영하는 방식은 조금씩 다를 거예요 그래서 저는 반차도 있는 회사를 상정해서 이제 그어 폼을 만들고 있고요 경조 휴가나 예비군의 경우에는 이렇게 별도의 메뉴로 만들어 주면 좋습니다 해당 휴가의 경우에는 어 휴가 등록은 해야 되지만 실제로 자녀 휴가 일에서 차감이 안 되게 하는 조금 다른 분류로 관리해야 되기 때문에 렇게 드랍다운 리스트를 만들었고요 첫 번째 문항을 그러면은 완료를 했습니다 연차 시작을 입력하도록 하고 이제 구성원들에게 뭐 어떤 포맷을 이렇게 그 줘서 에어 테이블 상에서 저 입력된 데이터를 가지고 계산될 수 있도록 이렇게 포맷 가이드까지 적어 놨고요 연차 종료도 한번 해 볼게요 이건 뭐 반 차나 반 반차는 뭐 이런 식으로 하고이 선택 입력값으로 이렇게 바꿔 줄 수도 있습니다 이렇게 포맷에 맞춰서 해 주시면 되겠습니다요 메뉴는이 폼이 제출될 때마다 누군가한테 이제 알려 줄지를 물어보는 건데요 어이 업무의 책임자에게 이렇게 DM 림을 줄 수도 있겠지만 제가 생각하는 시나리오는이 휴가 채널에서 어 바로 공개적으로 피드백을 해 주는 걸 생각하고 있으니까 어 별도에 dml 보내는 건 언체크 하도록 하겠습니다 이렇게 폼을 만들어서 사용자들로부터 데이터를 받게 됩니다 그다음에 입력받은 데이터를 에어 테이블로 넘기는 작업을 피어랑 연동을 하는 것으로 어 구현을 해 보겠습니다 이렇게 피어를 그다음 스텝에 넣어 주시고요이 제피를 통해서 슬랙 외부에 있는 다른 툴과 연동을 할 수 있기 때문에 어이 제피가 워크플로우에 이렇게 들어가 있으면이 기능이 굉장히 강력해지고 저는 에어 테이블에이 정 들어온 정보를 업데이트하는 시나리오를 지금 해보고 있는 겁니다 로그인을 하고요 뭐 어느 베이스에 그 정보를 업데이트 할지를 미리 그 베이스를 이렇게 준비를 해두고 어이 입력받은 데이터를 내가 준비해 놓은 테이블에 이렇게 입력시키면 되겠습니다 이렇게 입력을 하면은 이제 각 칼럼 별로 어떤 데이터와 맵핑을 할지 이렇게 쭉 나오게 되죠 이거는 포 입력받은 데이터랑 맵핑만으로 해 주시면 될 거 같고요요 그 신청한 사람 이름의 경우에는 응답값을 여기에 매핑해 줄 때이 폼을 입력한 사람 그니까이 슬렉 상에서 알 제가 폼으로 굳이 물어보진 않았지만 슬랙은 알고 있는 이런 제출한 사람 정보 같은 것들은 요런 식으로도 매핑해 줄 수 있어요 그래서 굳이 폼에서이 연차를 신청하는 사람의 이름을 물어볼 필요는 없는 겁니다 이렇게 구성을 해서 을 해보겠습니다 그러면이 폼이 입력될 때마다 그 데이터가 에어 테이블로 자동으로 전송되는 것까지 보여 드렸고요 그다음에 그 채널에 메시지를 남기는 걸 해보겠습니다 추가 채널에 메시지를 남길 때도 입력받은 응답값을 가지고 남겨 줄 수 있습니다 그래서 누구누구님 어 정상적으로 신청 완료되셨습니다 이렇게 쓸 수 있죠 밑에 이렇게 예시로 나오는 거 보이시죠 그래서 이런 정보까지 써 줄 수도 있습니다 그래서 기간 뭐 사유 뭐 이런 식으로까지 남겨 줄 수 있을 겁니다 렇게 세팅을 하면 폼으로 휴가 신청이 들어올 때마다 에어 테이블로 데이터를 보낸 다음에 어 그 채널에서 피드백을 해 주는 것까지 할 수 있겠죠 요거 인클루드 버튼을 누르면 여기다 이제 버튼을 등록할 수 있는데 만약에 이제 연차 등록을 잘못했을 경우가 있을 거잖아요 아니면은 취소하고 싶거나 그럼 이렇게 취소 버튼을 눌러서 내가 신청한 연차를 취소할 수 있게까지 해 주면 정말 편리하겠죠 근데요 연차 등록 취소를 이제 어떻게 자동화할 건가 요거는 제가이 영상에서 다루지 않을 거고요 여러분들이 이제 궁금하다 이렇게 댓글로 달아 주시면 그다음 영상에서 또 이거에 대해서 좀 더 설명하는 영상을 별도로 촬영을 해 보겠습니다 이렇게 세이브를 해 가지고이 워크플로우를 퍼블리시 하면 이렇게 정상적으로 퍼블리시 됐다고 나오고요 그러면 제가 새로 세팅한 워크플로우를이 휴가 채널에서 한 번 더 해 보겠습니다 아까와 마찬가지로 이렇게 숏컷에서 부르고 보에서는 반차를 한번 해 볼게요네 네 이런 식으로 한번 해보겠습니다 그래서 이렇게 제출을 하면 어이 채널에서 이렇게 피드백이 오는 걸 확인할 수 있고이 연차 기록에서도 방금 남긴 반차 정보가 들어왔고 구성원별 요약 보면은 어 사용이 2일에서 2.5일 돼서 자녀 연차까지 렇게 반영되는 걸 확인할 수 있습니다요 에어 테이블의 경우에는이 베이스를 복사할 수 있는 링크를이 영상 설명란에 넣어 둘테니까 요런 시스템을 한번 도입해 보고자 하시는 분들이나 관심이 생기신 분들은 링크를 눌러서 베이스를 복지 하셔 가지고 각각의 요런 칼럼들이 어떻게 구성하 구성됐는지 보시면 좋을 거 같고요이 영상이 반응이 좋으면 좀 더이이 시스템을 더 잘 구현하기 위한 아이디어 같은 것들을 한 번 더 설명드리는 별도의 영상을 또 제작을 해 보겠습니다네 여기까지 그 슬랙의 워크플로우를 이용해서 어 우리 회사에 연차 관리하는 것을 어 자동화해 봤습니다 구성원들은 이제 슬랙 안에서 특정 채널에서 연차 신청을 하는 것만으로 다른 구성원들에게 내가 연차 신청한다 이렇게 커뮤니케이션 할 수 있고 그 시스템에 반영하는 것까지네 이렇게 보여 드렸습니다 굉장히 간편하죠 슬랙을 사용하는 스타트업 기업의 경우에는 슬랙 워크플로우를 이용해서 굉장히 손쉽게 어 그 여러 가지 시스템을 자동화할 수 있을 것 같고요이 슬랙이 내부 어드민에 그 입력하는 인터페이스가 되는게 저는 굉장히 혁신적이고 편리하다고 생각이 듭니다 그래서 여러분들도 꼭 한번 해 보셨으면 좋겠고요 저는 다른 자동화나 노코드 스타트업 커리어 관련된 영상 또 준비해서 네 다른 영상으로 또 찾아뵙겠습니다 좀 더 자주 어 영상을 공유할 수 있도록 좀 더 노력해 볼 생각이니까요 앞으로도 많은 기대 부탁드립니다 어이 영상이 도움이 되셨으면 구독과 좋아요도 꼭 부탁드릴게요\n",

솔루션 만든게 괜찮은 거예요 개발 도중에도 채팅이 필요하잖아요 그거를 좀 팔아봤는데 이게 돈이 되는 거죠 매출도 4년이 지나서 2017년에 1억불 정도 했어요 6년 후에는 1.5 [음악] 빌리언이십일 들이 보고 따라서 만들든가 아니면은 뭐 그 회사를 사든가 본적으로이 생태계가 계속 커지는 거예요 저희가 지난 한 세 편에 걸쳐서 사스가 어떤 거고 왜 우리가 사스를 어 살펴봐야 되나 빅테크는 예전에 우리가 쭉 봤고요 그다음에 이제 어떤 회사들을 볼 건가라는 해 주셨잖아요 그 이유들을 한 세 편에 걸쳐서 봤던 거 같고요네 이번 편부터는 이제 실질적으로 어떤 회사가 또 어떤 분야에서 두각을 나타내는지 그게이 전체 생태에 있어서 무슨 역할을 하는 회사인 건지 이런 걸 좀 강론으로 들어가야 되지 않겠습니까 다시 한번 이제 사스라 무엇인가에 대해서 한번 더 점검을 보면 좋을 것 같은데 결국 사스는 우리가 모든 걸 만들어 쓰지 않고 남들이 만들어 놓은 걸 가져다 쓰는 거고 뭐 마이크로소프트 뭐 오피스라는 슬레이라이드 이거를 다양한 형태로 가져다 쓰는 거죠 대부분 이제 웹이나 앱 기반으로 저희가 그대로 이제 솔루션을 가져다가 월 정액을 내면서 쓰거나 아니면 API 기반으로

있다고 봅니다 그래서 왜 저희가 사스를 공부해야 되는가에 대한 이야긴데 첫 번째는 저희가 일을 할 때 직접 다 만들어서 쓰거나 우리가 일하는 방식 그대로만 쓰면은 사실 그 과거에 얽매이는 거거든요 그래서 시장에 나와 있는 다양한 사스 솔루션들을 보고 어떻게 하면 우리가 일을 더 잘할 수 있을까 효율적으로 일을 돌릴 수 있을까 이런 분석을 해 볼 수도 있고 두 번째는 세상이 돌아가는 걸 알아야죠 그래 시장을 파악해야 아 저렇게 돌아가고 있구나 그래야 뭐 뭐라도 저희가 다음에 할 수 있는 거죠 마지막으로는 저희가 지금 아마 비즈니스를 한다면 뭐 B2 C 하고 있다 그러면 사실상 B2 비록을 확장하면 매출이 더 쉬울 수도 있거든요 언제나 그렇지만 그래서 뭔가 사스 시장이 어떻게 돌아가는지 이런 기업용 솔루션 에 어떻게 돌아가는지 보면 아 우리도 저쪽에 좀 뛰어들 수 있지 않을까 우리가 기존에 B2 C 만들어 놓은 솔루션을 잘 바꾸면 비투비에서 매출을 될 수 있지 않을까 그래서 결국 어 생산성도 올리고 시장도 공부하고 미래 비즈니스 찬스도 참고 그래서 사스를 이런 솔루션들로 좀 공부해보면 좋겠다가 이번 시즌의 목표입니다네이 사스를 우리가 이제 왜 공부 하냐라고 했을 때 이제 말씀해 주신게 일단 우리 조직의 생산성을 올릴 수 있다는 거 저도 노션을 일부러 이렇게 써 보면서 기사 쓰거나 아니면 뭐 정리할 때 훨씬 더 놓치는게 줄어들었거든요 일이 좀 빨리 되더라고요 내 개인 상성에 진짜 되게 중요한 거 같고요 그렇죠 이런 사스를 보면 또 특징이이 회사들은 그것만 열심히 하는 회사예요 저희가 이제 생산성 사스 할 때 이제 인사 관리 HR 스도 볼 텐데 아무리 뭐 한국의 대기업 집단이 있고 그 대기업 안에서 내부적으로 쓰려고 그 솔루션을 만들었다고 해도 사실 그 사람들이 고민하는 그 스케일과 이런 HR 전용 사스 솔루션을 만드는 사람 들의 고민하는 스케이 다를 수도 있거든요 그리고 사실 이제 대기업이라 그러면 그 안의 문화에 따라서만 만들었을 거잖아요 뭐 한국의 유명한 사스 회사 뭐 플렉스 같은 경우에는 사용하는 회사가 벌써 6만 개가 넘어요 결국 6만 개의 회사가 고민하는 걸 합쳐서 그걸 다 해결할 수 있는 솔루션을 만들어 외를 쓴 거잖아요 그 말은 즉은 저희가 그 솔루션 갖다 쓰면 사실 6만 개 회사에 대해서 고민한 거를 얻을 수 있으니까 말하자면 저희가 뭐 한 200명이 사람을 가지고 뭔가 제품을 만들어야 되는 거를 굉장히 쉽게 한 달에 2만 원 내고 쓸 수도 있는 거죠 그래서 뭐 노션 같은 것도 은는 보다 조스 같은 솔루션을 가져다 쓰는게 훨씬 더 옳습니다 그렇게 쓰시다 보면은이 요새는 다 사스로 나오니까이 전체 시장에 대한 공부도 되실 수 있는 거고 그다음 또 사스는 보통 B2B 수익을 많이 올린다고 말씀해 주셨으니까 B2C 회사다 치면은 사스 시장을 보시면서 아비가 여기서 이렇게 돌아가고 있구나 공부하시면서 또 그쪽에 진출을 하실 수도 있는 거고 가지 배울 점이 있다라고 이렇게 정리를 해주셨습니다 그래서 저희가 이제 사스 강론으로 드디어 들어갈 건데요 크게 분류를 해 주신게 생산성 프로덕티브 하나가 있고 그다음에 세일즈 쪽을 해주셨고요 그다음에 보안 그다음에 개발 이렇게 크게네 개로 갈라 주셨거든요 그중에서 이제 제일 큰 카테고리 이제 생산성을 오늘 한번 다뤄볼 텐데 생산성이 워낙 많기 때문에 사실 다 생산성 아닙니까 그 생산성 내 똑같은 고리를 몇 개를 나눠 주셨어요 그래서 그 생산성 내에 진짜 생산성 자체가 있고 그다음에 HR 쪽이 있고 그다음에 채용 그다음에 관리 운영 쪽이 하나가 있고 또 교육 이렇게 나눠 주셨습니다 일단 제일 처음인 생산성 큰 카테고리 내에 진짜 그 딱 생산성에 해당하는 그런 어 서비스들 한번 짚어보면서 시작을 하면 좋을 것 같습니다 그 부분이 그 저희가 이제 생 생각하는 생산성 하면은 아까 노션 생산성이 거 같고요 뭐 커뮤니케이션네 이런 것도 다 생산성이 거 같고 좀 어떤 것들이 있나요 생산성으로 들어가게 되면 제일 기본은 소통에 관련된 거니까 뭐 이메일 그리고 캘린더 그다음에 주소로 뭐 여기까지는 완전 기본이죠 거기에 사람들 데리고 일을 해야 되니까 이제 거기에 당연히 채팅이 들어가는 거고 거기에 이제 온라인 스토리지 요즘은 뭐 파일도 다 온라인에 올라가는 거니까 여기에서 이제 어 테스크 매니지먼트 거기에 이제 도큐멘테이션지 심지어 말씀하셨던 노션 그래서 결국 저희가 일을 하면서 소통을 하고 나온 결과 문들을 뭐 어딘가에 문서를 정리를 하고 또 테스크를 관리하고 그면 팅 하 이렇게 반인들이 많고이 시장이 사실상 굉장히 크고 기본입니다 여기 재밌는 건 여기에 한국적인 문화가 좀 더 개비가 돼요 그래서 한국은 어 조직도가 굉장히 중요합니다 그래서 조직도가 중요한데 재밌는 건 제가 다녔던 미국 회사들은 조직도가 별로 없어요 조직도 자체가 없다고요네 왜냐면 조직이 너무 빨리 바뀌기도 하고 뭐 어차피 내가 누구랑 일을 하냐에 따라서 이렇게 일을 하는 거지 우리 회사에 큰 조직을 이해하지 않아도 일하는데 상관이 없습니다 근데 조직도는 거는 보통 이렇게 내가 누구한테 보고를 하고 그 사람한테 평가를 받고 그다음에 그 라인으로 그리면 조직도가 다 나온다 맞습니다 그래서 사실상 뭐 어느 회사의 명함을 다 모았다고 생각하면 조직도를 그릴 수 있겠죠 하지만 그거를 실제 조직도의 도표로 만들어 놓거나 관리하지는 않는다는 거죠 대부분의 미국 회사들은 어차피 내 보수가 누군지 나랑 일해야 될 사람 누군지 자연스럽게 아는 거죠 근데 이제 한국 회사들은 딱 그런 조직도가 있고 그 조직도 안에서 이렇게 권한 관리를 하고 뭐 이런 거를 되게 중요하게 생각하는데이 회사들의 문화 차인 거 같아요 조직도를 중요하게 생각하는 문화와 그 없어도 된다라는 문화 그래서 뭐 어떤 회사들 같은 경우에 처음에는 조직도를 좀 그리다가 나중에 조직이 너무 자주 바뀌고 사람이 너무 많이 뽑히니 조직도 관리하는게 부하가 걸리는 거예요 그래서 조직도 안 할래 하는 회사도 있습니다 아 이게 예를 들어 한 30명 리 회사면 금방 그리는데 뭐 구글이나 아마존처럼 막 몇십만 명 있고 이러면 그거는 이제 그리기가 되게 힘들긴 상 그 그리고 업데이트 하는 것도 그니까 어차피 만들어 봤자 틀린 정보라는 거 아 그니까 약간 중국이 인구 조사하다가 늘어나는 거처 맞습니다 맞습니다 그래서 조금 더 이렇게 그 근처에 있는 사람들만 이제 정의해서 보여 주는게 어를 수도 있고 또 최근들어서는 그 미국 쪽에 조직도 사스 회사들이 별로 없어요 워낙 이게 수요가 없기 때문에 하지만 뭐 궁금한 사람도 있다 보니까 이거를 이제 머신러닝으로 사실 다 분석을 해서 사람들의 여러 가지 정보도 분석해서 가상으로 조직도를 만들어 주는 뭐 예를 들면 그런 회사들도 나오고 있는데 어쨌든 한국은 딱 조직도라는 솔루션들이 있고 보통 이렇게 업무용 솔루션은 조직도를 많이 원하죠 하지만 이제 글로벌하게 이제 제일 많이 그 팔리는 어 프로덕티브 이제 솔루션을 보면 결국 어 일반적인 이제 큰 회사들은 마이크로소프트 365 이게 이제 다 들어 있으니까요 뭐 이메일 뭐 채팅 뭐 다 들어 있죠 온라인 스토리지까지 그걸 쓰고 있습니다네네 이게 좋죠 잘 만들었어 하지만 어 이제 구글 워크스페이스 이것도 많이 써요 스타트업들은 이제 구글 솔루션들을 많이 쓰는데 이제 구글 워크스페이스는 웹에서만 돌아간다는게 또 단점이긴 합니다 그 아무래도 그러다 보니까 네트워크 속도도 좀 따르고 브라우저에서 해다 보니까 약간 이제 제한도 있고 하지만 마이크로소프트 솔루션들은 이제 웹도 있지만 다 이제 앱으로 어플리케이션 설치해서 쓰다 보니까 조금 더 편하기도 하죠 기능도 더 많고요 그렇죠 결국 이제 마이크로소프트와 구글이 어떻게 보면 이제 양 산맥을 다 먹었다라는 볼 수 있는데 여기에서 아까 말씀드렸던 뭐 테스크 매니지먼트 뭐 지라라가 아니면 문서 관리 뭐 노션 같은 경우에는 제 3의 솔루션이지만 워낙 그거는 잘 만들고 많이 쓰이기 때문에 쓰입니다 그리고 뭐 구글이나 마이크로소프트는 조금 더 소통 쪽에 문서 쪽에 집중하고 있고 이런 이제 노션이 지나는 그거보다는 약간 개발자들이 있을 수 있는 이쪽으로 집중해서 좀 시장이 이렇게 섞여 있어요 재밌는 거는 슬랙 같은게 또 재밌는데이 아무리 구글 워크스페이스 쓰거나 마이크로프트 365를 써도 슬랙을 또 많이 써요 추가로 어 사실 구글하고 마이크로소프트에 있는 공짜 버전을 쓸 수도 있는데도 팀지 있잖아요 그래도 이제 슬랙의 기능이 더 좋고 사람들이 이제 슬랙이 편하니까 그래서 이런 식으로 시장에 이제 기회가 있는 거죠 더 잘 만드면 물론 이제 마이크로프트음 열심히 슬랙을 보고 따라서 새로운 걸 더 계속 개발하기 때문에 같이 발전한다고 봅니다 이게 아까 이메일 쭉 설명을 해 주셨는데 어거 당연한 거 아니야라고 생각해 봤더니 이메일도 분명히 엄청난 서비스인 거잖아요 그게 보통 우리 구글 지메일을 쓰거나 아니면 이제 MS 메일을 쓰는데 이것도 두 개 회사가 먹고 있는 거고 캘린더도 생각해 보니까 구글 캘린더 많이 쓰잖아요 아이 밖에 진짜 오프라인 달력을 안 쓰게 된게 결국은 구글 캘린더 썼던 거 같고 그다음에이 주소록도 결국은 구글 안드로이드랑 연결해 놓거나 애플 뭐이랑 연결해 놓거나 이렇게 되는 거고 어 온라인 스토리지도 원드라이브 많이 쓰고요 아니면은 구글 저는 구글 포토 때문에 구글 스토리지도 쓰거든요 둘이 다 해놓고 있군요 그렇죠 그렇죠 그 재밌는 거는 이제 처음에 사스를 왜 공부하는 가에 대한 이야기도 나오지만 이런 사스 회사들이 계속 튀어나와서 뭔가를 만들면 결국 이제 그 회사도 돈을 벌어요 뭐 슬랙 같은 것도 다른 회사에 인수가 됐기도 했고 뭐 이런 식으로 로 어 굉장히 많은 사스 회사들이 나오면 빅 테크이스트 이게 그 고여 있는 물이 죽는 물이든 그래서 빅테크 그이 이미 장악을 하고 있어도 끊임없이 새로운 사수 회사들이 나오고 새로운 제품들을 만들고 이게 계속 이렇게 그 다이나믹하게 시장에 돌아가면 본적으로이 생태계가 계속 커지는 거예요 그래서 저는 이런 그 많은 회사들이 나와서 좋은 걸 만드는 거가 결국 구글하고 마이크로소프트 같은데도 도움이 되기 때문에 결국 그 처음에 얘기하듯이 빅테크 공부하는데 필요한게 또 이런 이제 이런 사트 회사들 공부하는게 또 다 연관이 있다고 봅니다 마이크로소프트 같은 경우도 팀지 힘을 주기 시작한게 아무래도이 슬랙이 막 큰 다음부터 아니었습니까 그렇죠 그다음에 요새 노션이 비슷한 것도 또 만들고 있는 거 같고요 거기에 이제 자기네들 서비스를 이렇게 계속 붙이고 있는 거 같은데 스타트업이 나와서 어떤 분야를 파고 들면서 시장 자체가 생기는 거군요 그렇죠 뭐 구글 미트 같은 경우에도 구글도 동영상 뭐 이렇게 화상회의 솔루션을 두 세 번 만들었는데 계속 별로였어요 그러나 가 결국 줌이 이제 엄청나게 잘 되니까 어쨌든 이제 구글도 열심히 새로 만들어서 이제 구글 미은 이제 많이 좋아졌죠 근데 결국 경쟁작이 있어야 같이 올라가는 거라 저희가 이렇게 빅테크에 투자를 한다면 그 빅테크 그이 이런 사스 스타트업들과 어떤 식으로 일을 하는가를 좀 볼 필요가 있는 거죠 근데 만약에를 들어서 너 줌이 나왔는데 너무 좋아 갖고 구글은 뭐 우린 구글 미트 같은 거 포기할 거야 그러면 안 좋은 사인인 거죠 결고 그걸 사든가 비슷한 걸 만들든가 결국 이렇게 쓰이는 제품에 대해서 계속 이렇게 경쟁을 해야죠 마이크로소프트도 끊임없이 뭐 팀도 계속 계란에서 슬 하고 싸우고 이런 이런 그 돌아가는 다이나믹한 걸 보여 줘야죠 회사들이 그렇게 시장을 같이 열어나가는 거군요 신기한게 지금 구글 마이크로소프트는 예전에 저희가 다루기도 했었고 굉장히 큰 회사인데 거기에 하나 더 말씀해 주신게 슬렉 이잖아요 요기는 어떤 회사길래 지금이 두 회사랑 이렇게 견주고 있는 겁니까 아 슬랙이 그래서 참 대단한 회사고 슬랙에 대해서 좀 공부해 보면 재밌는 거를 많이 볼 수 있는데 어 일단 슬랙은 어 재밌는 거는 처음에는 이제 게임 회사였어요 아 실력이요 그니까 게임을 만들려고 했는데 어 게임을 만들기 위해서는 뭐 여러 가지 도구들이 필요한데 그 중에 하나가 내부에 소통을 좀 더 빠르게 하려고 약간 채팅 솔루션을 만는 거예요 물론 이제 게임 안에도 채팅이 필요해요 게임 사용자들끼리 하지만 뭐 개발 도중에도 채팅이 필요하잖아요 근데 그 당시만에도 이렇게 쓸만한 채팅 솔루션이 많지 않았어요 네이트온이나 이런 거 안 썼는 분 외 외국 회사라네 네네네 그렇죠 그래서 괜찮아 아이디 예 그래서 결국 자기네들이 채팅 솔루션을 만들었는데 네 그거 팔 이게 돈는 거죠 게임은 잘 안 유니티도 그랬습니다 유니티도 사실 게임 만들려고 하다가 게임 엔진은 괜찮게 나는데 게임은 별로였는데 뭐 엔진이라도 팔아볼까 해서 대박난 경우죠 그래서 언제나 회사는 내가 만들려고 했던 걸로 성공하지 않습니다 그거를 하면서 이거저거 저거 하다 보면 어어 걸리는 거죠 카카오톡도 뭐 열몇 번째 만든 거잖아요 아 그랬나요 그때 경우도 50번째 만든 게임이었고 그래서 수없는 실패 끝에 뒤에 이렇게 뭔가 얻어걸리는 거죠 물론 앞에 이제 쌓인 역량과 경험이 되는 거기 때문에 하지만 어쨌든 슬랙 게임에서 시작했는데 좋은 그 채팅 솔루션을 만들어서 그걸로 이제 성공한 경우고 당연히 여기서 이제 굉장히 많은 노력이 많이 들어갔어요 그니까 입소문이 났나 보네요 아 저 팀이 자기네들 개발하면서 이렇게 채팅 솔루션이 괜찮다 뭐 입소문이 좀 났나 보어 오래 걸렸습니다 생각보다는 매출이 올라가는데 오래 걸렸고 하지만 이제 제품을 만들어서 내고 그다음에 그 개발 속도가 엄청 빨랐어요 아 제품을 만들어서 이제 내면서 시작이 된 거군요 막 옆에서 야 그거 좀 줘봐 이제 이게 아니라 우리가 게임은 망했는데 우리가 생각해도이 채팅 솔루션은 괜찮은 거 같은데 하면서 이제 그렇게 팔기 시작한 거죠 근데 물론 이제 엔터프라이즈가 당연히 그렇듯이 쉽지 않았어 처음에는 근데 채팅 솔루션 내고 사람들의 반응을 보고 그다음에 또 이제 개선을 하고 근데 이거를 굉장히 빠르게 열심히 개선을 해서 이렇게 빠르게 좋아지고 이제 그게 이제 입소이 난 거죠 예를 들면 이제 개발자라는 뭐 여러 회사들이 써 보니까 그 전에는 이제 업무형 채팅 솔루션 같은게 별로 없었거든요 이메일에 부족한게 되게 많잖아요 생각보다 이메일에 단점도 되게 많고 근데 어 채팅을 해 보니까 훨씬 편안해라고 이렇게 굉장히 빠르게 채팅으로 넘어가고 약간 또 트렌드도 있는 거 같아요 요즘 뭐 mg 세대 같은 경우에는 예를 들면 뭐 카톡으로 전화 그어도 돼 물어보고 전화를 한다든가 아니면 이제 카톡으로만 다 하는음 그리고 뭐 체 같은게 뜨는 것도 약간 채팅이네 우리의 약간 기본이 되는 그런 시대로 가고 있기 때문에 이제 슬랙으로 일을 하는게 사람들이 더 편해지는 바로 앞에 사람이 있어도 말하는 건 서로 부담이니 슬러그로 그거 끝났어 그 저쪽에서 이제 하트하트 보내고 뭐 이렇게 일을 하는 문화가 생긴 거죠 어쨌든 이런 거를 잘 캐치업 해서 어 슬랙이 계속 올라갔고 어 그러다 보니까 매출도 2013년에 첫 수수을 했는데 4년이 지나서 2017 전에 1억불 정도 했어요 그 많이 오르기 올랐죠 근데 4년 정도 걸려서 1억불 정도 했는데 13년인 6년 후에는 1.5 빌리언이십일 불을 하는데 거기에서 15억 불을 할 때까지 굉장히 이렇게 빠르게 성장을 한 거죠 어떻게 이렇게 슬랙이 성장을 했나에 대해서 많이들 분석을 하고 보는데 결정적으로 이제 슬랙이 잘하고 있는 걸 세 가지를 보통 뽑는게 시장에 따라서 계속 애자일하게 빨리 움직이는 거 그래서 시장이 뭘 원한다 그러면은 계속 그런 기능을 넣어주는 그래서 다른 어떤 회사보다도 빠르게 시장에 반응을 했고 물론 이거 뒤에는 지속적으로 그 개발을 해요 그니까 제품도 더 좋게 만들고 회사도 좋게 하고 그 계산하기 위한 노력을 계속 하는 거죠 왜냐면 시장의 반응을 봐도 그걸 느리게 내를 수도 있잖아요 시장의 반응을 본다 근데 그거를 굉장히 빠르게 한다 약간 게임사 마인드가 있네요 그렇죠 게임이 원래 온라인 게임은 내놓고 나서부터 시작이잖아요 계속 이벤트하고 업그레이드하고 더 붙이고 막 그런 좀 마인드가 있군요 최근에도 굉장히 많은게 변합니다 그래서 예를 들면은 채팅을 쭉 했더니 사람들이 그중에서 이제 몇몇 중요한 것들은 이제 북마크를 하고 싶은 거예요 그래서 북마크를 하다 보니까 약간 이게 내 테스크 같은 거잖아요 어 그래서 그 기능을 되게 강화해서 약간 북마크 기능에서 약간 테스크 기능을 바꿔서 내가 채팅한 것들에 약간 테스크를 이렇게 선택할 수 있게 해주고 그것만 따로 관리해 주면서 테스크 매니지먼트 솔루션도 안에 집어놓고 있는 거예요 생각해 보면 당연한 거잖아 이런 식으로 사람들이 원하는 기능들을 조금씩 넣어보고 그 되는 거 같으면은 되게 빠르게 정리하는 그래서 이렇게 큰 회사인데도 시장에 그 대응하는 속도가 어 장난이 아니라고 봅니다 그 유 중에 하나가 이제 이런 시장의 반응을 본다 그리고 굉장히 빠르게 그거를 개발해 낸다 다음으로 오픈 이노베이션으로 어 슬랙은 API 다 열어놨어요 그래서 예를 들면 제가 이제 구글 드라이브에 있는 문서를 링크를 셀렉해서 올린다 근데 그 두 개를 연동해 놨어요 계정을 그러면은 그 문서의 프리뷰를 보여 준다든가 아니면은 그 문서에 권한이 상대편은 없어요 그러면 제가 링크를 보내면 안 되잖아요 채팅에서 그렇죠 저 저 받는 사람은 권한이 없는데지 누면 바로 거기서을 수 해주는 거 슬 그렇죠 그래서 구글드라이브 사이트 가서 뭔가를 하는게 아니라 슬 내에서 모든 걸 다 할 수 있게 해주는 그게 API 다 연동이 되는 거죠 근데 생각해 보시면은 이제 세상에 모든 것들이 다 API 연결할 수 있기 때문에 결국이 구글에 API 슬랙 API 연동시키면 슬랙 내에서도 굉장히 많은 일을 할 수 있는데 이렇게 슬랙에 연동된 외부 솔루션들이 지금은 거의 뭐 한 몇백 개가 넘을 정도로 어 너무 많기 때문에 사용자가 일하기가 너무 편해지는 거죠 그 회사들 입장에서도 슬 내로 들어와야 자기네들의 유료 결제 유료 어 서비스 같은 거를 사람들이 돈 내고 슬렉 안에서 편히 쓸 쓸 거니까 뭔가이 슬랙이 플랫폼 역할을 하게 되는 거예요 그렇죠 그 뭐 구글 드라이브다 그러면 굳이 슬랙을 안 지원할 일는 없는 거예요 어차피 편하게 되는 거니까 물론 이제 경쟁 상대가 있어서 좀 문제가 있을 수도 있지만 어쨌든 다 열어 넣는 거죠 그래서 예를 들면 마이크로소프트 같은 경우에는 이제 마이크로소프트 팀스 있으니까 우리는 이제 마이크로소프트 원드라이브 안 열어 줄 거야 뭐 이렇게 나올 수도 있지만 구글은 사실 뭐 채팅 솔루션이 특별한게 없으니까네 다 열어 줄게 뭐 이렇게 될 수도 있는 거죠 물론 이제 전략적 제로도 할 수 있겠지만 생각보다 이제 슬랙에 연동된 솔루션들이 굉장히 많고 이런 오픈 이노베이션을 통해서 이게 일하는 사람도 되게 편한 거죠 내가 슬랙 man 가지고 모든 걸 다 할 수 있게 되는 거예요 그 쓰는 사람들은 인터넷 브라우저처럼 쓰면 되는 거네요 그 안에서 모든 걸 잘 할 수 있는 그렇죠네네 그래서 말씀하신 것 약간 브라우저처럼 약간 슬랙이 플랫폼이 돼서 다른 수많은 업무형 솔루션들 뭐 휴가 신청하고 뭐 휴가 가고 뭐 근퇴 관리하고 뭐 테스크 관리하고 이런 것들이 슬랙 안에서 약간 채팅이 라는 인터페이스를 통해서 뭐 웹 브라우저처럼 나머지 뒤에 수많은 어플리케이션 연동돼서 다 돌아가게 할 수 있는 거죠 근데 그런 슬랙을 세일즈 포스가 엄청 큰 돈을 주고 인수를 했잖아요 여기 세일즈 포스도 그러면은 구글이나 마이크로소프트는 이제 결어 보겠다 약간 이런 얘기입니까 아니 이게 말씀하신 것처럼 그니까 회사를 인수하는게 사실 쉬운 일은 아니에요 돈이 너무 많이 들기 때문에 그래서 뭐 특히 마이크로소프트 같은 경우는 직접이던 솔루션이 있으니까 그래서 사실 개선할 수밖에 없었고 구글은 이제 채팅은 없지만 비슷한 걸 만드는 건 쉽거든요 근데 뭐 구글이 워낙 많 많이 만들었다가 워낙 많이 접기도 하잖아요 아마 고민 많이 했을 거 이걸 만들까 아니면 계속 밖 연동만 잘되면 되는 거니까 근데 그러다가 갑자기 슬랙이 전혀 다른 회사에 인수돼 가지고 우리 지원을 끊어버리면 그것도 곤란하잖아요 그래서 항상 이렇게 인수할까 만들까 근데 저 회사가 딴데 팔리면 어떡하지 이런 걸 다 고민을 해야 되긴 해요 근데 다행히 이제 슬랙 같은 경우에는 세일스 포스에 인수가 되는데 여기서 이제 세일스 포스는 세일즈 곧 비즈니스 이렇게 영업을 하고 판매를 하고 뭐 매출을 내고 하는이 비즈니스의 어 프로세스를 관리해 주는 거예요 crm 많이 알려 뭐 그 여러 가지가 있습니다 그 crm 다 훨씬 더 많은 걸 하면 그래서 그냥 비즈니스의 모든 거를 관리하는 그런 프로세스를 독로 만들어는 거죠 예 그러니까 자기네들이 정말 잘 디파인 했어요 우리 같으면 고객 만나서 계약하고 돈 받으면 되지라고 3단계로 하겠지만 사실은 그 밑에 예를 들면 한 20 단계가 있는 거예요 뭐 계약서 리뷰를 해야 되고 뭐 계약을 해야 되고 뭐 입금을 해야 되고 고객한테 일단 연락을 해야 되고 이제 리뷰를 해야 되고 이게 실제 고객이 돼야 되고 뭐 하여튼 굉장히 많은 프로세스가 있는데 그거를 이제 툴로 만들어 가지고 전 세계에서 제일 비즈니스 잘하고 있는 회사인데 결국이 비즈니스에 프로세스는 있는데 그 비즈니스에 이제 결국 소통이 들어가야 되잖아 근데 커뮤니케이션 쪽에서 이제 슬랙이 짱인 거죠 그래서 어떻게 보면 두 개가 이제 시너지가 나올 수도 있는 거죠 지금까지는 이제 프로세스를 우리가 컨트롤 했다면 그 프로세스 안에서 돌아가는 커뮤니케이션까지도 하겠다 아 그리고 고객들고 연락들 어 옛날에 이메일로 많이 했어요 요즘은 슬랙으로도 많이 하거든요 외부 고객들을 슬랙으로 초대해도 그 일을 많이 해요 그러니까 초기에는 이메일로 많이 하는데 중간에 좀 깊은 대화를 하면 바로 슬랙으로 초대를 합니다 이메일은 아무래도 조금 불편한게 있으니까 관리가 잘 안 되잖아요 그리고 산내 커뮤니케이션은 이제 요즘은 다 슬랙이 한의 커미션이 전부 슬랙이 외부 커뮤니케이션은 이제 이메일보는법 생각해 보면은 세즈 포스가 슬랙을 사서 약간 이런 비즈니스의 프로세스뿐만 아니라 커뮤니케이션까지 다 해서 할 수 그래서 구글이 슬랙을 사는 이유와 세일즈 포스가 슬랙을 사는 이유는 다를 거예요 예 근데 어쨌든 본인이 생각하는 그림으로 이제 가는 거죠 물론 이제 세일즈 포스도 워낙 큰 회사고 바쁘고 하다 보니까 아직 빠르게 뭔가를 내놓지 않아요 뭐 마이크로소프트 같은 경우에 인수하면 되게 빠르게 뭘 하거든요 어 뭐 구글 같은도 그렇고 근데 세일즈포스는 덩치가 더 크다 보니까 좀 오래 걸리는 거 같긴 한데 어쨌든 이제 슬랙 가지고 뭘 할지는 계속 이렇게 관심을 가지고 봐야 되긴 합니다 생각해 보니까 슬랙이 메신저 아아 그 단순하게 얘기하면 근데 우리가 뭐 와츠 앱이나 뭐 카카오톡처럼 일반인들이 하는 메신저가 아니라 일할 때 하는 메신저라는 관련돼 있긴 한 거군요 그렇죠 그렇죠 그리고 사실 슬랙의 가장 큰 차이점은 걔네들이 이제 쓰레드는 용어를 만들어 냈거든요 어 쓰레드라는게 요즘은 이제 일반 채팅 프롬도 놓고 있는데 원래 채팅은 그냥 이렇게 계속 왔다 갔다 하는 거예요 거기에서 주제라는 개념이 없어요 어 그냥 막 돌아가는거죠 근데 슬랙에서 주제가 있으면 그 주제에 다구를 밑에다는 거예요 아 그러면은 뭐 예를 들면 한 채팅 방에서 어 세 가지 주제에 대해서 이야기를 안 섞이게 잘할 수 있는 거죠 아 이메일에 이렇게 쓰레드 비슷한 거죠네 이메일은 그 하나하나가 쓰레드 아면 채팅은 이렇게 이 약간 평면으로 늘어놓는 거잖아요 근데 이제 슬랙은 거기서 레드라는 개념을 둬서 뭐이 이야기를 하면 거기에 이제 댓글 받고 다른 이야기하면 또 댓글 나고 해서 훨씬 더 관리가 되는 거죠 그리고이 채널 자체가 또 여러 개 그래서 예를 들면 마케팅 채널 뭐 개발 채널 뭐 HR 채널 그 안에 뭐 쓰레드 이런 식으로 해서 조금 더 업무 관리를 잘할 수 있도록 신경을 많이 쓴 거죠 그 시작은 진짜로 카카오톡 같은 그냥 채팅이 있는데 단순한 지금은 거기에서 뭐 굳이 말하자면 카카오톡 뭐 5.0 정도가 될 정도로 굉장히 복잡한 잘할 수 있도록 툴들이 많아지는 재밌는 건이 맞든 것들을 반대로 그 원래 채팅 프로그램들이 옛날 옛날에 나오고 슬레이 나와서 엄청 발전하고 나서 다시 이제 다 따라가죠 그래서 카카오 톡에도 답글 기능 같은 거 생겼잖아요 그죠 답글 들어가고 이모티콘 거기에 들어가고 그게 사실은 슬랙에서 다 시작한 거거든요 아 아 그 대화 어떤 말 하나의 요새 좋아요 찍는게 그게 원래 거기서 시작한 거군요 아 그죠 생각해 보면 비즈니스로 하는데 저쪽에서 이거 어떻게 어떻게 됐습니다라고 정보성 말을 했어요네 그럼 매번 그거에 대해서 잘 알겠습니다 네네 얼마나 귀찮아요 근데 그냥 그냥 이거 체크해주면 되는 거죠 그래서 생각해 보면 이모티콘 하나 달아주는게 너무 편한 거예요 근데 그거를 어떻게 보면 페이스북에서 사실 시작을 한 거고 슬랙이 그걸 또 따라한 거고 그걸 요즘은 이제 채팅에 또 따라하는 거죠 심지어 저희는 슬랙 같은 메신저를 쓰고 있는데 그거를 투표 기능으로도 쓸 수 있더라고요 뭐 31 5일 7일 한 다음에 거기 좋아요 찍어 주세요 그러면 책이 제일 맞네요 뭐 이런 식으로 되고요 그러니까 결국 그 그 사용자들이 계속 투를 쓰면서 또 변해요 근데 그거에 맞춰서 슬랙은 계속 이렇게 맞춰 따라가서 지금 계속 업계 1위를 이제 공고해 하고 있는 건데 뭐 끊임없이 경쟁은 나올 겁니다 그리고 계속 세상은 변할 거고 뭐 이메일에 비해서 슬랙이 엄청나게 좋아졌지만 아직도 갈기를 멀어요 여기 말씀드렸던 이메일 뭐 캘린더 뭐 어드레스북 뭐 채팅 온라인 스토리들이 아직까지도 많이 분산돼 있고 이게 더 통합돼야 될 거고 특히 캘린더 같은 경우에도 뭐 개인 캘린더 뭐 회사 캘린더가 다 막 따로 놀기도 하고 거기에 뭐 일까지 하니까 저희가 업무용으로 쓰는 솔루션이 진짜 저희가 원하는게 100이다 그럼 저는 지금 한 60 정도인 거 같아요 아직도 남아 있는 시장이 많고 계속 이런 솔루션들은 좋아질 거예요\n",

것 같은데 맞아요 아 제가 저번 주 그러니까 딱 일주일 전에 나갔던 비디오가 제목이 자마린 사용한 기술인가 뭐 자말 그런 아니 아니다 슬랙에 사용한 기술인가 이런 식으로 제목을 냈어요 슬랙앱 에 대해서데 비디오가 나가고 나서 굉장히 빠른 시안에 천명이 맞는데 한 그때쯤 돼서 어떤 분이 댓글을 주셨어요 잘못된 내용 아니냐 그래서 확인을 해 본 결과 잘못된 내용이어서 그 비는 내렸어요 근데 비디오를 내렸는데 문제는 이미 천명이 봤잖아요 그래서 아 천명이 본 이상 어쩔 수 없이 또 다시 비디오를 만들어야겠다 생각해서 만드는게 오늘 비디오예고편 지금 잘못된 거 얘기를 하려고 했던 건 아니었는데 잘못된 내용부터 짚고 넘어가자면 아 제가 그 비디오에서 어 슬랙 앱 있잖아요 모바일 앱 그거를 자마린으로 만들었다라고 얘기를 했어요음 근데 그거는 사실 무근이라고 제가 확인했을 때도 그렇다고 생각을 했는데 아 슬랙이 자마린 이용한게 아니라 슬랙이 자마린 제공하는 테스트 클라우드라는 또 다른 서비스가 있어요 근데 저는 는 당연히 뭐 좀 있다 얘기하죠 근데 그거를 썼던 거예요 결과적으로 그래서 뭐 이게 뭐 유 앱을 올려 놓으면은 UI 자동으로 드리븐 해 갖고 이렇게 테스트를 쫙 해 보는 그런 플랫폼인데 뭐 그런 자동 테스트를 통해서 이제 새로운 버전이 나올 때마다 품질을 보장하기 위해서 썼던 쓰는 것뿐인 거 같아요 근데 실제 자마린 앱은 네이티브로 만들었다 자만이 슬래 앱은 네이티브로 만들었다고 하더라고요 그러면 단 뭐 왜 그니까 뭐가 잘못되지 정정을 했으니까음 그러면 왜 그런 일이 제가 그렇게 이해하느냐 설명을 하면은 제가 저편 비디오 보신 분은 알겠지만 어떤 분이 제 슬랙 책방에서 아 마이크로소프트 뭐뭐 하시는 분에게 들었는데 자마린 슬랙으로 아니까 슬도 자마린으로 만든 거예요라고 해서 어 그래요 그렇게 부드럽게 나올 수가 있었나 그래서 제가 봤는데 이제 자마린 홈페이지에 도 우리 거를 쓴다라고 하면서 우리 자마린 테스트 클라우드를 써라고 설명을 해놨어요 저는 이제 당연히 자마린으로 만들지 않하면 자마린 테스트 클라우드를 못 돌린다고 생각했기 때문에 그게 자마린으로 만들었다고 생각을 한 거예요 그래서 제가 이거를 이제 사람들이 왜 비디오 내렸 있냐고 물어볼 때 개인적으로 정정을 해줄 때 어 자마린으로 만들어야만 그게 되는게 아니었어 하시는 분들 역시 있었어요 그니까 나만 긴게 아니라 다 낀 거였지 근데 결과적으로는음 그게 이게 아니더라고요 그래서 뭐 마소도 그렇게 낚으려고 대충 해 놓은 거겠지만 그래서 저도 낚고 남도 겼고 그래서 결과적으로 말하면 슬랙은 자마린으로 만든게 아니에요 어 근데 이제 재밌는게 제가 그래서 곧바로 비디오를 내리고 뭐 여기저기 댓글 달리는 거 잘못된 거라고 얘기했을 때 또 재밌는 반응을 보이시는 분들이 있었어요 그냥 남들은 그렇게 잘못하면 뭐 이렇게 피하기 바쁜데 되게 쿨하게 인정하고 넘어간다고 근데 제가 그때 답을 했던 게 뭐였냐면 아니 누구나 실수는 할 수 있다고 보고 그 실수를 했을 때 얼마나 빨리 잘못을 인정하고 어 그 잘못된 정보가 퍼져 나가는 걸 막냐 얼마나 빨리 할 수 있냐 저는 그거에 따라 결과적으로는 사람이 계속 신뢰를 유지할 수 있냐 없냐가 유지된다고 생각을 한다고 말했거든요 근데 그거는 뭐 지금도 마찬가지고 제가 언제나 그렇게 살아온 것도 사실이고 그리고 앞으로도 그렇게 산 거 같고 비디오에서도 몇 번이나 말했던 거 같아요 제가 비디오에서 정확히 얘기했는지 다른 거에서 얘기했는지 기억 안 나지만 제가 되게 싫어하는 사람들 중에 그런게 있다고 얘기했던 거 같아요 그러니까 거짓 아 맞아 혼자 생각하기 비디오 이런 거에서 만들 말했던 거 같은데 제가 남한테 잘못된 정보를 들어요 그러면 저는 그거를 확인도 안 하고 여전히 퍼티는데 이제 동조를 하는 거죠 한마디로 잘못된 병균에 숙주가 돼서 마고 퍼티 이듯이 제가 그런 숙주가 된다는 거 자체도 저는 제 잘못이 있다고 보거든요 그리고 사람들 보고 그렇게 퍼트리지 말고 어느 순간에는 누군가 잘못된 정보가 퍼지는 걸 막을 수 있다고 보는데 그 자기가 그 책임을 못했으면에도 불구하고 나중에 거짓을 다 퍼트린 다음에 어 난 몰랐어 내 잘못 아니었어라고 한다는 거 자체가 저는 말이 안 된다고 얘기를 했어요 계속 그래서 그건 저는 말 그대로 뭐라 그럴까 능동적인 거짓말은 아닐지언정 수동적인 거짓말이라고 생각한다고 얘기했고 제가 요번에 그런 거짓말 장애가 된게 된 거예요 그래서 서 잘못된 내용이고음 뭐 저 이전에도 그 똑같은 얘기를 퍼트리는 분들이 있으니까 혹시 뭐 그분들이 보신다면 자마 그니까 슬랙을 자마로 만들지 않았다 슬랙은 뭐 찾아보면 나와요 무슨 스택으로 만들었는지 되게 힘들게 힘들게 해서 나왔는데 아 뭐 제가 까먹었고 어쨌든 자 마리는 아니었어요 그래서 그거였음 뭐이 비디오가 나간다고 해서 제 그전 비디오를 본 사람 천 명이 다 볼 거라는 보장은 없거든요 사실은 그랬으면 좋겠는데 음 어든 제목부터 그래서 저번에 제목은 되게 뭉뚱 그리게 그냥 슬랙을 만든 기술 이런 식으로 얘기했지만 요번에는 그냥 아이 때문에 박을 수밖에 없어요 슬랙은 자마이 아니다 이럴 수밖에 자마린으로 만들지 않았다 그래서 그렇게 해서 뭐 사람들이 제목만 보고도 잘못된 정보가 뭔지를 알게 하고 싶은게 제 마음이고 그럼 이제 제가 아까도 처음 시작할 때 말했지만 들었다는 얘기를 하는게 주 얘기는 사실은 아니었어요 제가 저원 비디오에서도 밝혔지만 지워진 거 제 자랑을 하기 위해서 만든게 전부였어요 왜냐하면은 오늘도 그 제가 자랑할 만한 그 비디오에 또 댓글이 달렸는데 그 좀 있다 말하고 제가 예전에 몇 년 전쯤에 이제 자마린 무료가 될거다 왜냐면 마소가 인수를 했고 마소가 이제 윈도우스 폰 버리는 상황에서 얘네 소프트웨어를 넘겨 받아야 되면은 자마린 같은 걸 만들어서 양쪽을 지원하는 거를 점점 나갈 거고 일반 사 무로 풀 거고 이제 거기서 어떻게 모델을 찾을 거다라는 식으로 얘기를 했거든요 근데 이제 그게 몇 년이 지난 얘긴데 문제는 그 지금부터 그 중간 사이에 그렇게 현실로 일어났어요 실제 자마리 현재 무료고 아 웬만한 사람들한테 그래서 이제 그거를 내가 맞았다는 비디오를 만들기 위해서 만든게 전부였는데 사실은 그러면서 대놓고 제목부터 자랑을 할 수 없으니까 이제 자마리의 기 뭐 슬래그 키수 이렇게 나왔던 거죠 그래서 결과적으로 말하면 제가 그때 말했던 일은 현실화 됐고 실제 요즘 아 2 지금 17년이 요즘 마소에서 이벤트 하는 거 보면은 자마린 쪽 공짜 이벤트가 되게 많아요 마소 오피스 기반으로 자마린 사용법이라 워크샵을 엄청나게 진행하고 있고 그리고 최근에 이제 자마린 폼스 세 버전 나온 거 보니까 이제 커스텀 폰트라 이런 부분도 좀 더 잘 만들었고음 뭐 예전에 비디오 보시면 알겠지만 제가 자마리 좋아하는 유이 있었고 뭐 디버 환경이 좋다거나 그 그걸 보시면 될 거 같아요 그래서 최근 들어서 이상하게 그 처음에 올렸던 비디오에 댓글이 많이 달렸어요 이유는 몰라요 마린에서 무슨 일이 있었는지도 모르겠고 한국에서 갑자기 자마린이 또 뭐 여기저기서 소개가 돼 갖고 사람들이 더 보는 건지도 모르겠는데 아니면 제 비디오를 누가 퍼가 갖고 뭐이 사람이 맞았다 이런게 어디 올라간 걸지도 모르고 최근에 그냥 어 정말 자만이 공짜가 됐네요 이거 어떻게 예측하 막 이런 얘기를 다신 분이 많고 오늘은 뭐라 그러더라 오늘은 그뭐이 비디오 보고 정말 지렸다 그러던가 식으로 말을 했어요 그러니까 그니까 어떻게 이걸 맞췄냐 이런 식으로 이렇게 글을 쓰신 거거든요 근데 뭐 당연히 과장 법이고 뭐 뭐겠는가 그 당시 볼 때는 이거는 뭐라 그럴까 예측을 한 건데 이렇게 안 가는게 말이 안 된다라는 생각이 들어서 예측을 한 거예요 그니까 제가 이제 가끔 비디오에서 예측하는 것들이 있어요 그리고 솔직히 그 예측들이 지금 보면은 몇 년 1년 2년 3년지 다 맞았거든요 뭐 아직 안 밝혀진 것도 몇 개겠지만 밝혀진 거는 다 맞았어요 여태까지는 그래서 뭐 요즘도 또 이제 drar 옛날에 예측한 거 보면 즘 또 드디어 똑같은 얘기들 신문에서 나오고 있고 어 그래서 그냥 그거는 알아줬으면 좋을 것 같아요 제가 뭐 어디 와서 이렇게 뭐 예측을 할 때 그냥 그냥 아무 생각 없이 아 이게 이럴 거야라는 추측을 하는게 아니라 생각을 많이 해보고 정말 이렇게 안 갈 수가 있나라는 개 이렇게 안 가기가 너무 어렵다라는 개성이 있으면 그걸 얘기하는 것 뿐이거든요 그래서 이런 거는 그냥 단지 그 당시에 돈은 뭐 그냥 뭐 찌라시 같은 뉴스 언론 이런게 아니라 자기 혼자가 생각을 해야 나오는 거 같긴 해요 그래서 예전에도 뭐 혼자 생각하기 던가 뭐뭐 이런 얘기를 많이 했고 똑같은 개념으로 그런 것처럼 자기가 현재 이렇게 돌고 있는 이런 트렌드에서 내가 과거에 봤던 패턴들과 아 이게 과연 인간이 이런 거를 제대로 사용할 수 있을까 라는 거를 생각을 하면은 그런 거에 대한 예측이 좀 더 나올 것 같고 이게 단지 그냥 뭐 노스트라다무스가 돼서 명성을 끌겠다 이게 아니라 자기 개인의 이제 뭐 커리어를 갈 때도 되게 여러 가지가 많아요 요즘도 최근에 좀 커리어를 다시 잡고 싶은 또 어떤 애를 하나 얘기를 하고 있는데 너무 주변에 소식이 많고 자기가 정확히 뭐가 될 건지 판단이 안 쓴다는 거죠 그래서 그 상황에서는 자기한테 그거를 직접 말해줄 수 있는 사람이 있거나 그러나 그 사람이 언제나 옆에 수는 없잖아 그럼 자기가 온갖 많은 노이즈와 온갖 많은 정보에서 추입 걸 추려서 아이 방향으로 갈 확률이 가장 높구나 그럼 그쪽에 마음을가 가다듬고 그쪽으로 노력을 해야 되는 건데 세상이 온갖 수만 가지가 존재하니까 거기 정신 팔리다가 집중을 못 하는 경우인 거죠 그래서 뭐 어쨌든이 비디오에 가장 중요한 주제는 잘못된 거 정정이 있어요음 그게 제 사랑보다 먼저가 대다니 참 놀라운 일이죠 슬랙은 자마린으로 만들지 않았습니다 제가 잘못한 말이고요음 그리고 뭐 슬랙에 쓴 건 뭐 자마린 테스트 클라우드 있고 자마린 아고 상관없어요 그러고 뭐 자랑을 뺄 순 없으니까 제가 예전에 자마린이 공짜가 될 거라고 했던 건 맞은 거였고 이런 예측이나 이런 거에 그냥 뭐 어떻게 가능하지가 아니라 그냥 혼자 생각해 보고 패턴 분석을 하다 보면은 대충 나오는 거 같아요 이런 거 부분들은음 뭐 그 정도 뭐 다른 내용이 없었네요 사실은 제가 밑 보인 거 말고 예 보였습니다\n",

오늘의 질문인 거죠 그럼 참가자들이 여기에서 이제 그 본인의 생각을 댓글로 달아 주면 되겠죠 헌 돼 이게 댓글로 다는 것을 이 아래쪽으로 계속해서 여기 댓글창에 달 매는 타임라인이 너무나도 길어 집니다 저희가 질 질문답변 질문답변 질문답변 이렇게 1시간 동안 쌓인 것과 질문 들면 쭉 보이는데 답변은 다른 곳에 쌓이는 것과 우리가 다음에 해당 질문과 답변을 찾아올 때 검색 가능성이 라던지 가시성이 굉장히 많이 달라지겠죠 해서 여기서 저희가 추천드리는 대화 방식은 요 지금 현재 이 질문에 답변을 할 때 싫다 내 아까 잠시 소개해 드렸는데요 실타래 버튼을 누르고 여기서 글을 잡으시면 됩니다 4 뭐 예를 들면 뭐 제 생각은 내 이와 같습니다 하고 엔터 키를 누르신 거죠 그럼 리플라이 가 하나 달렸습니다 또 어떤 사람은 뭐 제 생각은 비와 갖습니다 라고 또 누가 달아줄 수도 있겠죠 4 자 이렇게 지금 하나의 글 속에 실타래 로 댓글을 달다 보니까 지금 현재 여기 타임라인에 는 질문만 보입니다 하지만 여러분이 쓰레드 기능을 눌러보면 쓰레드 즉 실타래 로 다른 댓글들이 보이는 거예요 예를 들어 여기서 이제 두번째 질문은 요런식으로 또 들어갈 수 있겠죠 이 질문에 대한 대 포로는 여기서 마치겠습니다 5 추가질문 계속 달아주시면 제가 뭐 스터디 후에라도 4 답변 드리겠습니다 그리고 이제 다음 질문으로 넘어갈게요 라고 엔터키를 치즈 자 그리고 여기에는 본인이 다음 질문을 적습니다 4 3주 1차 이렇게 지금 질문을 이렇게 붙여 넣기 할 때 약간 서식이 있으면 좋아보여 이길 하겠네요 제가 느끼기에는 할 때 뭐 3주 1차 선택 복습 질문인데요 여기서 이거를 뭐 볼드 채 하는 방법 알고 계시죠 해가 지고 화면은 좀더 포멧이 달라집니다 여기에도 또 참가자들이 자유롭게 쓰레드를 이용해서 보니 댓글을 달 수 있을 것 같습니다 참 좋은 질문이네요 어 이렇게 보시면 지금 현재 2개의 질문과 4 뭐 여러 개 답변들이 해주면 제 토론방 에서 이루어지고 있습니다 이렇게 만약에 여러분의 1시간 동안 토론을 하게 되면은 뭐 5개 6개 정도 질문과 폴은 답변 될 그런 것들이 오가면 1시간이 그냥 순식간에 삭제가 되어 버릴 겁니다 이 질문들은 기본적으로 한 주 동안 공부했던 내용들 드래 없이 스터디 코치 들께서 주관과 제로 참가자들에게 내주었던 그런 숙제 될 그런 것들에 대해 토론을 하면 된다고 보시면 될 것 같구요 그래 여기서 또 한 가지 중요한 것은 타임 매니지먼트 즉 시간을 잘 조절하는 겁니다 여러분이 60분 동안 스타일을 진행한다고 하면요 그중에 5분정도 앞뒤로 는 내 인사말과 또 삶은 조사 같은 것들 한다고 보시면 되고 실제로는 50분 정도의 스터디를 진행하는 4 그 토론에서 진행이 되는 소 몽 시간이라고 보시면 되겠습니다 그 50분 동안 여러분이 한 모 5개의 질문에 대해서 질문과 답변 그리고 자유 질문 이런거 뭐 추가를 한다고 해도 4 그렇게 하면 이제 뭐 질문과답변 당 한 10분 정도씩 시간을 쓰게 된거죠 어 토론 참가자 들이 굉장히 활발하게 뭐 의견을 달아 줄 경우에는 한 질문에 10분정도 5 여김없이 사람이 10명 들어오는데 시간이 모자랄 수 있습니다 그렇기 때문에 그 타임 매니지먼트 들 신경 쓰시기 바라고 4 이 질문에 대해서 제가 그래서 어 여기 까지 토론 마치겠습니다 시간관계상 그 다음으로 넘어가겠습니다 이런 포맷이 있었죠 이런 내용들을 잘 활용하면서 시간 조절 잘 해 주시기 바랍니다 그리고 이 실물에 대해서 너무나도 참가자들이 더 토론하고 싶어하면 문제 그래도 다른 질문들을 소화를 분명 해야 되기 때문에 저역이 적어 놓은것 처럼 계속 때 댓글 달아주시면 제가 스터디 이후에라도 댓글을 더 달아 드리겠다 라고 하면서 제 참가자들과 소통을 좀 더 활발하게 하는 거죠 그리고 여러분이 여기에서 이제 토론을 할 때 또 이건 스터디 코치들의 어떤 매너 같은 건데요 4 참가자들과 이렇게 이제 질문드리고 막 그 답변하고 하는 과정에서 뭐 누군가가 아주 재미있는 대답을 했으면 그 사람을 소화해서 어 누 구 님 답변이 뭐 최고신 요 그래서 뭐 예를 들면 이런 인사도 해 주면 그 사람 어깨가 덩실덩실 시 4 참가자 분들이 여러분의 빅센 이 될 수도 있습니다 에코 체험들 께서 스터디를 어떤 토론을 이끌어 가는 그런 방식이라고 보시면 될 것 같아요 이제 그 토너를 잘 이끌어가는 어떤 퍼스에 뭐 테이터 언어로서의 어떤 재능도 굉장히 중요하겠지만 기본적인 도구 사용법 익숙하지 않으면 아 뭐 뭔가 스터디 할 때마다 긴장되고 내 내가 뭐 실수하는 겁나 짜증도 나고 그럴 수도 있겠죠 기본적으로 여러분이 스터디를 시작하기 전에 오늘 어떤 질문들로 사창가 자 여기가 토론 하겠다라는 것들 어디 워드 파일이 나 이런데 써놓고 실제로 토론할 때는 그 내용을 붙여넣기 하면서 토론을 이끌어 가면 훨씬 더 준비된 자세로 유동적인 상황에 잘 대응하면서 토론을 진행할 수 있을 거라고 생각이 됩니다 그리고 간략하게 이렇게 텍스트 서식 조정하는 방법들 알려드렸던 내용들 꼭 한번 복습하면서 기억해 보시기 바랍니다 그럼 슬랙 사용법에 대해서는 여기서 마치도록 하고 다음에는 구글 행아웃 c 라고 하는 화상 채팅 서비스를 여러분이 활용해서 포로를 이끌어 가는 방법에 대해 한번 이야기를 해보겠습니다 여기까지 스터디 파 의 비지니스 팀 의 안녕 일이었습니다 감사합니다\n",

또 두가지가 있어요 지금 같은 라인은 이제 그래 주 레이 션에 커트가 되었을 때 나오는 쉐입이 고 이런식으로 감싸는 나이는 이제 레이에어가 됐을 때 나오는 감 이제 그건데 바로 피드에 들어갑니다 일단 기장이 지금 하도 안 맞습니다 그리고 질감 차이가 너무 많이 되어 있어요 지금 까 이것도 하고 싶고 저것도 하고 싶고 그의 단어 가능 거에요 머리에다가 그러니까 머리끝 거부 어가 원래 스타일의 욕심을 너무 많이 불린 거죠 차라리 예를 좀 덜어 내거나 이 부분을 좀 덜어 내거나 뭐 어떤 다른 부분은 좀 덜어 내거나 이래 써야되는데 스탈리 회사는 이렇게 안했을 거 같애 아 스타일링이다 있다 4 이렇게 할 수 있는 스타일링이 아니에요 지금 커트 자체가 음 그리고 질감 차이가 너무 많이 되어 있기 때문에 머리가 아까 흩날리는 느낌이란 말이에요 힘을 줘야 될 부분 것 가벼운 부분 각 무거운 부분과 적당한 부분을 이제 분배를 해서 이제 나눠 써야 되는데 각 구역별로 그런 것들이 아니라 1부터 10까지 다이 가볍고 머리가 이 끝이 막 달리는 느낌이 보일 거에요 대한 더 머리를 모르시는 분들이 봐도 자 이렇게 근력이 보면 다 이렇게 구멍들이 있죠 김 공간 여백 뜰이 자

쉽지가 않아요 결국 시장이 언젠가는 포화가 되겠죠 지금 요금제 가지고는 안 될 거예요 온라인 스토리지가 굉장히 큰 시장이에요 드랍 박스라는 처음에 새로운게 나왔었죠 구글 드라이브 뭐 마이크로소프트 원드라이브가 다 따라 왔죠 슬랙이 버티는 거보다 드랍 박스가 버티는게 저는 훨씬 어렵다고 봐요이 기술의 발전이라는게 하루 아침에 딱 뭔가 되는게 아니라 결국 그 사용자들이 계속 툴을 쓰면서 또 변해요 근데 그거에 맞춰서 슬랙은 계속 이렇게 맞춰 따라가서 지금 계속 업계 위를 이제 공고해 하고 있는 건데 뭐 끊임없이 경쟁은 나올 겁니다 그리고 계속 예상은 변할 거고 뭐 이메일에 비해서 슬랙이 엄청나게 좋아졌지만 아직도 갈 길을 벌어요 여기 말씀드렸던 이메일 캘린더 뭐 어드레스북 뭐 채팅 온라인 스토리들이 아직까지도 많이 분산돼 있고 이게 더 통합돼야 될 거고 특히 캘린더 같은 경우에도 뭐 개인 캘린더 회사 캘린더가 다 막 따로 돌기도 하고 거기에 뭐 모바일까지 하니까 저희가 업무용으로 쓰는 솔루션이 전자 저희가 원하는게 100이다 그럼 저는 지금 한 60 정도 은 것 같아 아직도 남아 있는 시장이 많고 계속 이런 솔루션들은 좋아질 거예요 이런 엄용 솔루션이 좋아지면 좋아질수록 저희 일을 하기가 편해지겠죠 예 알림도 주고 막 그렇죠 특히 이제 인공지능 l&m 뭐 이런 것들이 들어가면서 이런 솔류션이 더더욱 똑똑해질 것이고 뭐 예를 들면은 슬랙 같은 경우에도 그냥 제가 물어볼 수도 있죠 야 3일 전쯤인가 우리가 고객사 관련해서 뭐 이런 이야기를 했었는데 그때 우리 결론이 뭐였지 그러면 슬레이 쫙 대답해 줄 수 있는 거죠 아니면 일주일 동안 채팅 있던 내용들을 다 정리해서 주관 보호소를 만들어줄 수도 있는 거고 하도 많은 이야기가 왔 왔다 갔다 하다 보니까 그 약속은 어 몇 시였다 검색하기 되게 힘들거든요 그리고 AI 잘 정리해서 말려주고 하면은 뭐 훨씬 편하겠네요 근데 거기가 이제 슬렉 하나만 해도 지금 이렇게 안 되는데 이메일에 들어가 있죠 뭐 구글 닥스에 들어가 있죠 구글 드라이브에 들어가 있죠 제가 찾고자 하는 정보가 어디 있는지 몰라요 그래서 미국에 새로 나와서 이번에 굉장히 잘되고 있는 스타트업 중에 하나 여기도 쐈는데 이렇게 지메일 그다음에 이제 슬랩 그다음에 어 구글 드라이브 뭐 구글 닥스에 있는 모든 거를 합쳐서 검색을 해 줘요 근데 단순한 검색이 아니라 거기서 이제 LM 생성 AI 답변까지 해주는 거예 내용을 다 조합해 가지고 문장으로 대해주려고이 쓰는 거예요 물론 이제 아직은 좀 부족한 거 같아요 하지만 조만간에 이게 다 완성이 된다면 저희가 이렇게 다 흩어져 있는 정보들을 되게 쉽게 모아서 보여주는 솔루션이 나올 거고 이런게 또 굉장히 빠르게 시장을 공할 수가 있는 거죠 이런게 나왔을 때 슬랙은 최대한 오픈 돼서 지금 벌써 그 솔루션이 슬랙은 다 지원 하거든요 그런 식으로 서로 윈윈하는 상황이 벌어지는 거죠 이게 중천 개발자님이랑 인터뷰 약속을 잡으면 저희는 무슨 일이 벌어지면 일단 스튜디오 예약을 해야 돼요 이거는 또 다른 팀들이랑 조율을 해야 되기 때문에 엑셀에 가서 시간을 체크를 합니다 그서 쏴요 그다음에 어 잡혔어요 그리고 이제 저희 업무표 가서 이날 인터뷰 적어 놓고 그다음에 또 헷갈릴까 봐 또 캘린더에 따로 구글 캘린더에 가서 적거든요 총네 군 된가 적어요 이걸 다 따로 해야 되거든요 근데 이걸 통합해서 해줄 수 있는게 있으면은 한번에 다 되는 거잖아요 근데 문제는 이게 회사마다 다 다르다는 거예요 그래서 이제 뭐 요즘은 이제 그걸 이제 로보틱스 뭐 솔루션이고 이런 거를 이제 자동화 해 주는 걸로 되게 애를 많이 쓰고 있고 점점 더 좋아지고 있고 심지어 이제 AI 쪽으로도 가면서 이제 에이전트 일을 해 주는 거죠 아 그렇죠 그래서 방금 말씀하셨던 것처럼 내가 뭘 하고 싶어 그러면 그 행동에 대해서 기존 행동들을 공 학습을 해서 아 이렇게 이렇게 하면 되겠네 그래서 회사마다 다 다른데 그거를 강제로 통일시킬 수 없거든요 결국은 생각해 보면 테슬라 같은 경우에도 로봇을 만들 때 진짜 이상하게 생긴 로봇을 만들 수 있는데 사람하고 똑같이 생긴 로봇을 만드는 이유는 인류가 살아온 플랫폼 위에서 활동하기 제일 좋은 거는 사람 형태다 기존에 모든게 사람을 기준으로 만들어졌기 때문에 리도 하 못해 그러니까 그런 식으로 생각해 보면 로봇을 전혀 다르게 만들어 버리면 기존 산업을 쓸 수가 없어요 다 바꿔야 돼요 자동차가 바퀴가 다르게 생기면 도로를 다 바꿔야 되는 거예요 그런 점에서 모든 회사들의 그 프로세스를 다 바꿀 것인가 아니면은 이런 에이전트가 이제 머신 러닝으로 잘 똑똑해져서 기존에 하던 거 이렇게 이렇게 이렇게 이렇게네 개 하면 돼라고 이제 몇 번 가르쳐 주면 그다음부터 걔가 하면 되는 거잖아 그래서 그게 에이전트 레벨이 완성이 되면 굉장히 많은 사무실의 일들이 자동화가 될 것이고 그런 점에서 이런 프로덕트 B 쪽에서 제가 아까 60점이 이야기했던 건 갈길이 많아요 할게 많이 나와 있습니다 그 중에 하나가 아까 말씀드렸던 그 여러 가지를 다 보아서 이렇게 검색하고 생성해 주는 그것도 그거의 시작이라고 볼 수가 있죠 그거 완성이 이제 말씀하신 이제 에이전트 가겠죠 이게 또 혼자 힘 못할 거 같고 셀렉도 지금 많이 API 이렇게 오픈해 놔 갖고 오픈으로 간다고 하셨잖아요 그렇죠 그래서 근데 앞으로도 더 많은 사스이후이 사스는 서로 계속 연동이 돼 가지고 그래서 제가 앞쪽에 API 얘를 해서 우리는 그거를 그냥 이제 웹하 앱으로만 쓰지만 백 단에는 사실 API 가지고 다른 수많은 사스라 연동이 되거든요 그래서이 큰 생태계가 돌아가는 거고 점점 더 여기서 많은 일들이 벌어질 거예요 점점더 좋은 솔루션들 나올 거고 어 통합도 점점 잘 될 거고 예전에는 이런 솔루션들 통합에 굉장히 힘들어 했어요 API 만들려면 개발을 어마어마하게 했어야 되거든요 쉽지 않죠 API 전혀 없는 솔루션도 많고 그리 마이크로소프트 팀로 같이 쓰려고 그러면 걔는 안 열어나가는 이런 것들이 다 이제 연동이 돼서 굉장히 저희는 이제 솔루션을 신경 쓰지 않고 하고자 하는 일에만 좀 더 집중하는 시대가 곧 오겠죠 이게 AI 한번 이렇게 시장이 열리다 보니까 저희가 무슨 얘기를 하든 기승전 AI 기승전 AI 당연합니다 그래서 여러분들이 투자를 하실 때도 그 회사가 AI 일절 관계가 없다 그럼 다시 한번 생각해 보셔야죠 그렇기 때문에 저희가 1 2 3편 사스에 대해서 총론을 말씀해 주셨을 때도 계속 머신 러닝 얘기가 중간중간 끼어 들었잖아요 이런면 때문에 머신 러닝을 알아야 될 필요가 있겠군요 그러면 지금 들어 보면은 슬랙 같은 경우는 지금 뭐 MS 구글이랑 붙을 정도로 엄청난 회사 같은데 여기는 나중에 뭐 급으로 이제 올라갈 회사다 이렇게 생각을하면 될까요 어 문제 슬랙의 문제는 이걸 사실 이제 이런 사스 회사들의 이제 공통적인 도전이기도 합니다 옛날에 게임 같은 경우에는 뭐 디아블로 게임이다 그러면은 다 똑같은 가격을 해고 사잖아요 어떤 사람은 뭐 남들의 100배를 해요 그래도 사실상 어 동일한 돈을 하는 거고 이게 그냥 집에서 혼자 하는 게임이라면 상관없는데 서버가 있고 비용이 나가면 그렇게 안 되잖아요 근데도 불구하고 동일하게 받을 수밖에 없는 상황이었는데 그죠 와우 할 때도 한 달 한 두 번밖에 못 찾는데 똑같이 돈내니까 너무 막 근데 요즘은 이제 뭐 무료 과금을 하면서 그 조금씩 돈을 받는 아이템으로 뭐 그런 걸 하기 때문에 여러 가지 방식이 생겼는데 이런 스도 슬랙 같은 경우에도 예를 한 달에 예를 들면 뭐 한 만 원 정도를 받는다 그럼 그 사람이 아무리 많이 써도 만 원이고 좋게 써도 만 원인 거예요 그러다 보니까 사실상 한계가 있는 거죠 뭐 넷플릭스도 마찬가지입니다 어마어마하게 보는 사람도 뭐 15,000원이고 한 번 보는 사람도 15,000원이아요 근데 이거를 또 정량적으로 바꾸기 또 쉽지가 않아요 뭐 여러 가지 이유로 근데 슬랙 같은 경우에는 업무용으로 해비하게 쓸 가능성도 있기 때문에이 가격 정책이 좀 더 유동적이 되는데 그렇지 않은 상황이라서 이게 매출이 결국 올라가려면 사용자가 늘어 수밖에 없는데 결국 시장이 언젠가는 포화가 되겠죠 지금가 그래요 지금 넷플릭스도 어 쭉 가스 시장이 포화가 되니까 이제 결국 이제 광고 요금제 같은 걸로서 더보려고 하고 그리고 요금을 이제 올리려고 하기도 하는데 이게 갈 수밖에 없는 거예요 비용 계속 들어가니까 셀렉도 지금은 성장 단계니까 상관없지만 나중에 이제 어느 한계 나면 지금 요금제 가지고는 안 될 거예요 그러면은 이제 종량제로 간다든가 뭐 API 열어서 다른 서비스들이 슬랙을 쓸 때 이제 그 회사들한테도 돈을 받거나 다른 걸 많이 해야 됩니다 약간 사스에 이제 한계이기도 한데 저희가 어 돈을 벌 수 있는 솔루션에는 돈을 많이 써요 아니면 돈을 아낄 수 있는 솔루션에도 돈을 많이 써요 예를 들면 광고 플랫폼에는 돈을 많이 쓰거나 아니면은 뭔가 물건 같은 거 살 때 관리하는 거 이런 거는 돈을 좀 많이 쓰거든요 근데 이렇게 생산성은 없으면 종이하 패만 주면 되지 약간 이런 마인드가 있어요 그렇지 뭐 그런 식으로 뭐 없어도 돌라는 가는 거 같으니까 그래서 의외로 그 직원들의 생산성 향상을 위한 솔루션에 돈을 많이 안 쓰고 싶어 해요 제가 다녀본 회사들을 생각해 봐도 그런거 같습니다네 그래서 이제 그게 한계이긴 한데 어쨌든 이제 이런 좋은 솔루션을 쓰는 회사와 안 쓰는 회사 차이가 엄청 나거든요 뭐 직원들 퇴사여부 행복까지 가면 감을수록 이제 사스가 더 좋은게 나올 거고 이게 가치가 있을 거고 거기 비용이 점점 더 올라가겠지만 아직까지는 사스에 대한 인식이 그렇게 그 높지 않고 또 비용도 많이 내고 싶은 욕구가 없기 때문에 한국 시장이 유난이 좀 작긴 해요 여기에 돈을 잘 안 쓰려고 하고 또 대기업들은 그냥 만들어 쓰거든요 근데 다시 말씀드리지만 이런 좋은 솔루션들을 써서 어 우리도 발전하고 그런 회사들도 잘하면서 모두가 발전하는 그래서 이런 쪽에 좀 관심을 가지면 좋을 것 같습니다이 종량제로 갑자기 쓰라고 하면 회사들에서 진짜 야 이거 계속 뭐 말을 하면 할수록 돈을 많이 내야 되면은 이걸 쓰겠어고 생각을 할 것 같긴 하데요 근데 또 뭐 아 열심히 또 항상 인간들은 답을 찾으니까 그 와우 같은 경우도 나중에 제가 접속해 보니까 시간당으로 이렇게 과금하는 것도 생겼었다 고요 뭐 150시간 얼마 뭐 이런 식으로 뭐 그런 뭐 시간당이 생길 수도 있을 거 같고 뭐 다른네 또 완전 정액제가 아닌 다른 뭐 요금제가 생길 수도 있겠네요네 일단은 이제 이게 정말 좋아져서 이게 없으면 일을 못 한다 어 정말 우리 회사의 슬랙을 없으면 일을 못 할 것 같아요라고 직원들이 말할 정도로이 좋은 솔루션이 돼야 그다음에 이제 비용에 대한 여러 가지 이제 아이디어가 나오겠죠 근데 일단은 계속 좋아지고 있는 상황이고 어 조금 더 이런 모든 솔루션들이 정말 필수가 되는 어 시기가 오면 다양한 변화가 또 예상됩니다네 그리고 생산성은 MS 구글 여기만 보면 되는 건가요 어 그거 말고도 되게 많죠 그래서 예를 들면 대표적인게 이제 줌이 어 그래서 줌 나오기 전까지는 예를 들면 구글 미트도 대충 만들었는데 지금은 이제 엄청 좋아졌고 심지어 줌 같은 경우에는 이제 구글하고 뭐 관계를 잘하고 있는 건지 메일에도 그 캘린더에도 그 줌이 들어가 있어요 그래서 어 지메 캘린더에서 이렇게 일정을 만들 때도 그 화장 회이 툴 중에 하나로 줌을 선택할 수도 있어요 그거는 이제 서로 협력을 해서 하는 거지 이거는 줌이 원한다고 들어갈 수 있는 건 아니에요 왜냐면 글이 그걸 열어줘야 되는 거니까 그리고 심지어 구글은 슬도 잘 지원하는 그래서 조금 더 구글이 좀 더 약간 오픈돼 있는 거 같아요 물론 마이크로소프트는 이제 가진게 좀 있다 보니까이 내부에 있는데 밖에 것다 막 열어 주는 건 좀 사실 문화상 좀 쉽지 않을 것 같아서 이런 쪽에서는 구글이 좀 더 어 스하고 좀 더 연동이 잘 되지 않나 이렇게 생각을 합니다 마이크로소프트는 참 잘 벗겨요 그 예전이 한데 예전에는 마이크로소프트의 그 내부 그 슬로건 중에 하나가 임브레이스 익스텐드 있거든요 레이스라는 걸 이렇게 흡수한다는 뜻이고 익스텐드를 확장한다는 뜻이에요 이게 나쁜게 아니라 뭐 시장에 좋은게 있으면 그걸 가져다가 우리 더 좋게 만들면 되지 이게 나쁜게 아니에요 어떻게 보면 그 뭐 엑셀 같은 경우에도 원래 다른 좋은 그 스프레 시트들이 많았는데 우리가 더 좋게 만들면 되지 사용자한테 결 배니까 그래서 뭔가 벗긴다고 하면은 좀 표현이 좀 나쁜 거 같지만 항상 더 좋은 솔루션들을 어 저렴하게 다양하게 공부한다고 생각하면 또 고객들한테 큰 혜택을 주는 거니까요 이렇게 얘기하지만 저는 36 쓰고 있 개인적으로 돈을 내고 쓰고 있기 때문에 많이 붙었으면 좋겠습니다 그럼요 그럼요 그 저도 저 다른 회사의 제품이 기능이 좋아 근데 그거를 쓰기 위해서 이걸 다 버리고 간다 쉽지가 않거든요 근데 우리가 그 기능을 넣어 주면 예를 들면 애플이 그 기능 넣어주면 뭐 누군가 사람들 욕을 하겠지만 저는 행복하잖아요 그래서 언제나 경쟁은 좋은 겁니다 그 미국 그 정부가 하는 일 중에 제일 중요한게 반독점 이잖아요 뭐 아마존 같은 경우에도 그래도 지금이 두드러 맞고 있긴 하고 저는 한국 같은 경우에도 쿠팡이 나중에 너무 커져서 정말 아마존처럼 모든 걸 다하면 외 있지 않을까 생각이 좀 또 있는데 지금이 사스 세상은 일단 기본적으로 모든게 오픈이라 정말 좋은 거 같아요 여기서는 다 열려 있고 다 경쟁하고 이에서 많은게 벌어지는 거죠 그래서 어떻게 보면 어 반독 점에 제일 좋은 분야가 저는 스라고 봅니다 중 그다음에 또 뭐 볼 때가 있을까요 혹시 뭐 온라인 스토리지 잠깐 이야기를 하긴 했지만 온라인 스토리지가 굉장히 큰 시장이에요 그리고 사람들이 그걸 많이 쓰기도 하고 사실 뭐 드랍 박스라는 처음에 새로운게 나왔었죠 그리고 구글 드라이브 뭐 마이크로소프트 원드라이브 다 따라왔어 물론 구글 드라이브는 구글 세트에 워크스페이스에 들어가 있기 때문에 통합되고 마이크로소프트는 뭐 365에 들어 있으니까 이렇게 아무래도 경쟁력이 좀 좋죠 그래서 드랍 박스가 좀 힘들긴 하지만 아직도 오래도 버티고 있어요 그것도 대단한 거죠 슬랙이 버티는 거보다 드랍 박스가 버티는게 저는 훨씬 어렵다고 봐요 아무래도 이거는 통합돼 있기 때문에 이런 온라인 스토리지는 계속 더 발전할 것 같아요 단순한 스토리지뿐만 아니라 뭐 구글 포토 럼 그리고 구글 다스 같은 경우에는 사실 문서로 특화된 스토리지 같은 거잖아요 그렇죠는 어 할 수 있잖 더 발전을 많이하지 않을까 근데 지금은 예를 들면은 뭐 이메일이라도 너무 많기 때문에 어 다른 기계에 가서 일을 하려면 그렇게 쉽진 않아요 그러니까 뭐 하나의 로그인만 갖고 하기에는 좀 어렵습니다 근데 진짜로 이게 다 정리가 돼서 뭐 한 5년 후다 그러면 제가 아무 기계나 가서 로인 한 번만 하면 완벽하게 똑같은 상황으로 일할시 있는 시대가 오지 않을까 이게 생산성도 빨라질 것이고 그리고 뭐 예전에는 백업을 고민을 많이 했잖아요 근 요즘은 사실 온라인 스토리에서 넣어놓으면 백업 자체를 고민 안 하잖아요 그니까 그런 식으로 어 계속 좀 더 변화되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있고 그런 의미에서 고투 커넥트라이브고 마우스를 가지고 저 컴퓨터에서 쓰는 거죠 어 재밌는게 이것도 이렇게 약간 이런 사스의 흐름처럼 이렇게 변해요음 왜 처음에는 이런 그 리모트 데스크탑이 업무용으로 많이 쓰였어요 저희 같은 경우도 휴대폰 그니까 스마트폰 처음에 나왔을 때 집에 컴퓨터를 켜 놓고 돌아다니면서 화면만 보고 조절해 갖고 막 했었거든요 요새는 잘 안 쓰는 거 같아요 그렇죠 그래서 이제 이렇게 집에 컴퓨터가 있거나 회사에 컴퓨터가 있으면 밖에서 이제 다른 기계 가지고 거기 붙어서 일을 하는 식으로 했고 그게 꽤 쓸모가 있어요 왜냐면 그렇게 일을 했어야 되니까 근데 이제 클라우드로 다 넘어오게 되니까 사실 꼭 집에 컴퓨터에 붙 필 없이 는 이게 필 없 그래도 술 한번 나기 때에 야니까 서버 같은 거 관리 서버는 직접 그 기계에 가서 해야 되니까요 그래서 그런 식으로 남다가 근데 이거는 이제 뭐 aws 같은 클라우드가 나오면서 저희가 서버 관리를 이제 안하게 되죠 그 쓰 그러면서 또 해지니까 다시 솔루션 가지고 이제 고객 지원 내 집에 컴퓨터가 이상해 그러면은 뭐 이렇게 어떤 사람이 붙어 가지고 기계 수리해주고 이런 걸 할 수 있는 거예요 그래서 끊임없이 이렇게 기술이 한번 나오면 변화하면서 그 기술이 쓸모가 있 지금은 심지어이 기술이 어 베이스가 돼서 나오는게 사실 이제 게임 스트리밍이 든요 저쪽에 있는 게임 기계에서 게임을 돌아가는 화면을 받아다가 결국 저런 마우스하나로 갖고 게임을 하는 거잖아요 개념적으로는 동일한 거고 그때 만들었던 많은 기술들이 어떻게 보면 재활용이 되고 개념들이 재활용이 되는 거죠네 그래서 이게 기술의 발전이라는게 하루 아침에 딱 뭔가 되는게 아니라 항상 앞에 뭔가 나오고 이게 쓸모가 있었다가 좀 쓸모가 없었다가 나중에 그걸 다시 한번 또 제활 영 이런 식으로 굉장히 많은 컴포넌트들이 흩어져 있는 것들을 계속 조합하면서 새로운 기술들 새로운 미래들이 계속 벌어지는 거 같아 멋있는데요 그렇죠 그래서 고투 커넥터 같은 회사도 막 엄청 핫했다 이거 안 될 거 같아 그랬다가 다시 또 딴데 써 먹었다가 또 이랬다 이렇게 계 반복하고 있는데 이런 것들이 재밌는 거 같아 우리가 예전에 알던 클라우드 이러면은 다 스토리지 생각했었던 거잖아요 기본적으로 스토리지가 기반을 깔려야 아무튼 그 파일 저장을 할 수 있을 거고 그걸로 뭐 이제 앱이 연결이 되 고 뭐 워드도 열고 모두 열고 사진도 열고 할 수 있는 거니까 클라우드라는 용어가 그래서 지금은 너무 광범위하게 됐기 때문에 용어들을 좀 더 이제 명확하게 하려고이 온라인 스토리지라는 이제 퓨 표현를 많이 쓰기도 하고이 클라우드 스토리지 하기도 하지만 그리고 뭐 aws 같은 경우에도 그냥 이제 클라우드라고면 너무 헷갈리니까 그냥 예를 들면 aws 뭐 이런 식으로 aws 뭐 온라인 스토리지 근데 사실 개념적으로 이게 이게 다 클라우드인 거죠음 그래서 어딘가에 어 올려놓고 모두가 그걸 엑세스 한다라는게 결 클라우드의 컨셉 네든 클라우드는 스하고 사실 비슷하다고 볼 수도 있는 거고요 그 클라우드라는게 예전에는 그냥 클라우드라고 알고 있었는데 지금 여기서 사스 나왔고요 이야스 나왔고요 파스 나왔고요 온라인 스토리지 있고요 막 이게 이제 세 분나 되는 거군요 그렇죠 그럼 온라인 스토리지는 이제 사스로 이제 분류가 되는 거고 사스로 들어가는 거고 렇게 한번 생산성 내 생산성을 좀 알아봤는데요 이쪽은 정말로 많은 된데 더 혹시 알아볼 데는 없겠죠 네 이쪽 예서는 일단 기본적으로 그 쭉 저희가 이제 이런저런 이야기를 많이 했는데 여러분들이 다니고 계신 회사에서 방금 말씀드렸던 분류에 어 소프트를 뭘 쓰고 있나를 한번 생각해 보시고 만약에 저희가 언급한 솔루션들을 한 번 더 들어본 적이 없다 그러면 한번 도입을 고민해 보시는 것도 좀 좋을 거 같고 그리고 항상 지금 저희가 쓰고 있는 툴이 제일 좋은 툴이라고 생각하면 안 돼요 이거보다 더 좋은 툴이 분명히 있고이 툴도 더 잘 쓸 수 있는 방법이 있을 수도 있거든요 을 잘하는 것도 중요하지만 이일을 다음에는 더 잘하는게 중요하거든요 그래서어 항상 이렇게 풀과 프로세스에 좀 신경을 많이 쓰면 좋을 것 같아요 그래서 이야에 나왔던 제품들을 한 번씩 쭉 리뷰해 보면 어 좋을 것 같습니다 이게 생산성 내 생산성 지금 카테고리인데요 이쪽 정말 재밌는게 어 저도 노션 써 보고 뭐 슬랙 써보고 이렇게 하다 보면은 신기한 기능들 많아서 되게 재밌어요 그 예전에 모바일 처음 나왔을 때 앱 깔아서 이것도 해보고 저것도 해보고 하는 것처럼 처럼이 사스 내에서 특히 생산성 관련된이 서비스들을 한 번씩 테스트를 해 보시면은 아 내가 이게 불편하게 뭔가 하고 있었구나 많이들 테스트해 보셨으면 좋겠습니다네 어 그리고 뭐 한 마디만 더 붙이면 이제 저는이 가각의 솔루션들이 이제 기능이 굉장히 많이 좋아진 거 같긴 한데 하나하나가 이제 너무 많이 좋아지다 보니까 이렇게 중복된 기능들도 계속 들어가요 그래서 약간 더 통합 지금도 통합을 열심을 하고 있는데 이게 또 API 그만 통합을 하다 보니까 약간 한계가 있어요 근데 예를 들면 어 슬랙은 채팅 네 노도 사실 그 옆에다 멘트를 달 수 있거든요 그리고 구글 스도 옆에다 커멘트를 달 수 있잖아요 근데 그 커멘트 자체가 어떻게 보면 채팅에 거기 사람들이 대화를 주고 봤거든요 문서를 만들어 놓고 야 이거 무슨 뜻이지 물어보면 옆에 답을 해요 거기서 막 채팅을 해요 그러면 결국 어 구글 닥스 안에서도 채팅을 하고 노션 안에서도 채팅을 하는데 뭐 지라 같은 데서도 채팅을 해요 근데 슬렉 또 있어요 그러니까 사실 중복된 내용들이 다 있는 거죠 기능적으로 그러면은 제가 누구랑 막 이야기를 했는데 이게 진화에서 이야기를 했던가 이렇게 버 그러다 보니까 아까 말씀드렸던 이렇게 그 다 통합해서 검색해 솔루션이 그래서 나오기도 하는데 궁극적으로는 이런 것들이 어떻게 하면 더 잘 될 수 있을까 우리가 지라의 뭔가 아이템에 대해서 채팅을 꼭 지라에서 해야 되나 이게 슬레이 와서 할 수 있나 그러면 요게 굉장히 쉽게 좀 연동이 될까 요게 이제 다음으로 좀이 업계가 가져야 될 숙제일 것 같습니다 생각해 보니까이 예를들 호텔 예약이라고 하면은 예 부킹 다크만 있었는데 그게 호텔스 콤바인 나오고 뭐 나오고 계속 그게 잖아요 한 에 통합으로 해줄 수 있는 거에 통합도 나오고 쪽 통합이 나올 때가 되네 그래서 제가 볼 때는 이제 에이전트가 행위이 될 거 같아요 왜냐면 API 모든 걸 연동하는 거는 어 되게 힘들기도 하고 또 잘 망가지기도 해요 한쪽이 바꿔 버리면 다른쪽이 다 망가지니 그래서 굉장히 이렇게 어렵게 붙여 놓으면 또 이게 굉장히 이게 약해지거나 붙이는 방법을 찾아야 되는데 이런 거는 좀 해 수 있지 않을까 예를 들면 어 그냥 지라에 뭐 이렇게 거기서 세팅하고 싶다 그러고 그냥 슬 그냥 이야기 하면 아 자동으로 이걸 연결해 주는 거죠 에이전트가음 뭐 이런 식으로의 해결을 할 수 있지 않을건데 좀 두고 봐야 될 것 같습니다\n",

이번 시간에는 기업용 메신저 그러니까 업무 0 배신 저에 대한 말씀을 드릴 건데요 제가 예전에 국내에서 서 비싸고 있는 업무용 메신저 잔디에 대해서 말씀을 드렸었는데요 이번에는 전세계적으로 가장 많이 사용하고 있는 업무용 메신저 중 하나인 슬랙 에 대해서 한번 말씀을 드려 보도록 하겠습니다 아 자 우선 구글에서 이렇게 슬랙 을 검색하시면 되고요 자 이렇게 검색하시면 은 작업이 이루어지는 공간 이런 사이트가 나오죠 여기 가셔서 에 접속하시면 됩니다 자 올래 슬랙 은 영문 서비스 만 하고 있었는데요 어 작년부터 한글을 서비스가 시작이 됐습니다 그래서 국내에 있는 분들도 쉽게 내 사용을 하실수가 있는 형태라고 보시면 되겠죠 우선은 요금을 한번 볼 텐데 스탠다드 와 플러스 그리고 엔터프라이즈 가 있는데 가격이 여기에 나와 있죠 4 가격을 보시고 어 선택을 하시면 되는데 사실 소규모 나 문모 간단한 프로젝트를 위해서 잠깐 4 사용 하시는 정도는 잔디와 마찬가지로 무료로 사용을 하셔도 크게 문제는 되지 않습니다 어차피 메신저 에서 주고받는 배와 는 어 텍 스 트 기반 이고 묵언 파일을 공유하거나 그럴 때는 구글드라이브 구나 연동할 수 있는 클라우드 서비스를 이용하면 되기 때문에 처음부터 유료로 사용하셔도 상관 없지만 이런 외부의 서비스를 처음 이용하시는 기업이나 혹은 뭐 단체나 개인이 라면은 무료로 일단 사용을 해보시고 이게 어느정도 정착에 될 것 같다는 생각이 드시면 때 유료로 사용하셔도 충분히 괜찮다 이렇게 말씀드릴 수 있을 것 같습니다 자 그럼 이번에는 가입을 한 번 해 볼텐데요 제가 가입이 돼 있기 때문에 다른 계정으로 한번 가입을 해 보겠습니다 자 이 메일이 왔다고 하는데 바라는 개성에서 자 확인 코드 가 왔죠 761 백 초 6일 에 코드를 입력을 했구요 자 회사 또는 팀이 어떻게 되십니까 하는데 침 같은 경우는 실제로 팀이 일수도 있고 목 우선 아 혹은 어떤 프로젝트 단위의 팀으로 관리 하실 수도 있구요 규모가 크지 않다면 은 회사 이름으로 구성 하셔도 상관 없으니 그런데 이제 명칭 자체는 팀으로 돼 있다 이렇게 보시면 되겠습니다 저는 스마트 스토리 랩 이라고 만들겠습니다 다음으로 시고 어떤 일을 진행한 하고 나와 있죠 그냥 저는 어 간단하게 어플의 젝트 라고 쓰겠습니다 자 프로젝트에 대해 가장 이메일을 자주 보내는 대상이 누군지 예 오 동료 르 있으시면 지겠죠 이거는 즉 개인 메일은 예 쓰겠습니다 이렇게 함께 초대를 바로 하실 수 있는데 뭐 더 추가 하셔도 되구요 건너뛰기 하셔도 되는데 좀 추가를 하겠습니다 자 그러면 여기 보시면 스마트 스토리 렙 이라는 에 팀이 생성이 됐죠 자 2팀 그다 이제 회사 이름일 수도 있고 부서 이룰 수도 있는데 잎이 말에는 이렇게 채널 이 존재합니다 채널은 각 채팅방 이라고 보시면 되요 그래서 이지우 실수도 있고 그 다음에 더 추가하실 수도 있어요 그래서 이렇게 해서 4 채널에서 나가기 뭐 이름 링크 추가 옵션 추억 쑨 보면은 채널 바로 에 삭제를 하실 수가 있죠 이따 채 다 삭제하겠습니다 풀 불필요한 것들은 어차 너를 좀 삭제를 파 겠습니다 예 자나 일반은 삭제가 안되네요 자 그러면 일반의 있 음을 좀 어 바꿔 볼게요 뭐 공지 사항 이라고 바꿔보겠습니다 자 그럼 바뀌었죠 프로젝트라는 채널이 있고 공지사항 이라는 채널이 있구요 부서별로 만든다면 은 예를 들면 은 뭐 기획 t 모든 멤버 추가 는 아니고 특정 사용자로 하겠습니다 건너뛰기 하구요 그 다음에 3채널 다음에 뭐 영업팀 열심으로 4 만들고 보이긴 하는데 특정 사용자만 갈 수 있게 이렇게 할 수가 있죠 왜냐하면 그 부서의 실제로 속해있는 어 인원들 만 그 그 채널 그 방에 초대가 되고 이 메인 관리자는 모든 걸 다 관장 하지만 이런 것들을 통해서 각 채널의 그 인원들을 배치 시키는 그런 부분들을 할 수가 있는 거죠 자 이렇게 채널을 계속 쭉 만드시면 되구요 이제 채널마다 사람들이 들어오게 되면 은 여기서 이제 대화를 나으실 수 있는데 자 우선은 실제로 이 메일이 왔는지 한번 확인해보도록 하겠습니다 왜 지금 초대한 것을 확인하실 수 있죠 참여 개정 생성이 나오는데 이게 그 가입이 되어있지 않은 형태에서는 계정을 만드시면 되구요 저는 실제로 계정 있기 때문에 4 구글로 계속해서 재개정을 선택하고 제 이름으로 들어가도록 하겠습니다 자 그럼 이렇게 공지사항에 제 가슴속에 돼 있죠 공지사항과 억 프로젝트 경우에는 이 열려 있었죠 자 그런데 기획팀 과 영업 팀은 보이기는 하는데 누구나 참여 할 순 없죠 이렇게 어제가 기획팀 을 선택하고 채널 참여 를 누르면 은 내 이렇게 바로 참여를 할 수가 있어요 비공개 가 아니기 때문에 바로 이제 이렇게 참여를 할 수가 있는 거죠 의원은 제가 나중에 하기로 할텐데 슬랙 같은 경우는 뭐 잔디나 디타 서비스처럼 이렇게 웹 버전으로 생할 수 있지만 이제 프로그램을 방 모두 받아서 조금 더 안전하게 조금 더 속도로 써 안정성을 갖고 있게 프로그램 형태로도 사용할 수가 있습니다 자 그래서 저는 현재 공지사항 빅팀 프로젝트에 참여 가 돼 있는 거죠 여기 간단하게 어 안녕하세요 길을 언 남길 수가 있게 되어있구요 작을 마다 이렇게 보시면은 완료됨 뭐 살펴보는 중 여러 가지 반응들을 하실 수가 있게 되어 있고 모닝 트 복사나 일지 않음 네 그런 것들을 클릭해서 4 확인을 하실 수가 있게 되었습니다 멧세지 고민을 누르면 은 다른 곳에도 이렇게 공유해서 복사하기 를 하실 수 있어요 자 그리고 글을 쓰실 때 도 그래 뭐 국기 라든가 못 잉크 라든가 여러 가지들을 이제 추가하실 수 있고 이렇게 파일을 첨부해서 4 pc 에 나 파일을 첨부 를 하실 수도 있게 되어 있습니다 자 그리고 이쪽에 보시면은 다이렉트 매스 지라고 있죠 그래서 이렇게 한명을 지정해서 예 일대일로 이렇게 대화를 하실 수가 있어요 만약에 어여 기의 4 팀원들이 많이 있다면은 이제 다이렉트로 그러니까 일반적으로 우리가 뭐 카카오톡 같은 일반적 인 메신저 같은 경우는 일대일 대화 도 가능하지만 좀 불편하죠 그래서 모방을 4로 찾는 다던가 이제 업무적으로 이런 부분들이 조금 불편할 수 있는데 슬랙 의 경우에는 바로바로 채널에서 뭐 일대일 대화 일대일 대화를 하다가 채널에서 다시 이런 것들을 굉장히 빠른 속도로 할 수 있기 때문에 업무에 불필요한 부분들을 굉장히 많이 제거하고 시간을 단축시킬 수 있는 그런 요소를 갖고 있다고 보시면 되겠습니다 아 자 이번에는 다시 제가 처음에 가입했던 개정 i 스마트 스토리 렙 팀의 담당자로 이제 접속을 했는데 이렇게 낚아 이때 일대와 했던 게 바로 확인이 되죠 또 여기 보시면은 이제 슬랩 보시라고 되는데 이제 슬랩 벗을 통해서 뭐 고객 지원 센터 라든가 간단한 뭐 알림 이나 리마인더 를 할 수 있는 그런 일종의 체포 d 라고 보시면 되겠습니다 자 공지사항 에다가 제가 4 공지사항 그들 한번 올려볼게요 자 그러면은 여기 이제 대화들이 쭉 4 있는데요 이렇게 보시면은 반응도 있지만 회신 이라는 겠죠 회신은 이 글에 대한 댓글이 라고 보시면 되요 그래서 확인했습니다 이런식으로 댓글을 이 그 하나의 다가 여러개를 할 수가 있죠 일종의 그 페이스북 타임라인 형태의 구조를 갖고 있는 거죠 그 카카오톡도 댓글이 되지만 그 댓글을 모아서 이렇게 보기가 좀 불편하죠 그런데 이렇게 일반적인 이 업무에 관련된 메신저 들은 중요한 어떤 어지 사항이라 든다 그런 공지사항에 어 댓글들을 통해서 어떤 팸 날 형태로 업무들을 효율적으로 관리할 수 있는 그런 부분들이 있고 새로운 프로젝트가 생기거나 그럴 경우에는 또 채널을 또 개설해서 그 프로젝트에 맞는 업무들을 과 관련된 커뮤니케이션을 그 채널에서 할 수 있는 네 그런 장점들이 있다고 보시면 되겠습니다 자 그 다음에 이쪽에 부시면 더보기 라고 되어있는데요 작업 오기를 이렇게 선택하시면 은 앱 이라는게 있어요 자 이렇게 앱 으로 오시면 은 이제 구글 드라이브 모텔로 줌 뭐 트위터 구글 캘린더 굉장히 많은 앱들이 있는데 자 여기서 예를 들면 은 구글 드라이브를 추가하거나 모텔로 를 추가하게 되면 n 틀에 로 에서 어떤 데이터에 변화가 생겼을 때 근데 예를 들면 은 구글 캘린더에 공유되어 있는 캘린더에 우리 팀장님 이 새로운 일정을 입력했습니다 자 그러면 일정을 입력했다 라고 메신저 에다가 이루어져 주지 않으면 사실 바로바로 확인이 어려운데 이렇게 슬레 게 구글 캘린더 처럼 이렇게 연결할수 있는 앱들을 연결해 놓으면 그 06 캘린더에 변화가 생기거나 뭐 구글드라이브 새로운 파일이 업로드 했다던가 이런식으로 변화가 생기면 은 자동으로 그 감지해서 알려주는 알림 서비스가 자동으로 연계되는 그걸 형태라고 보시면 되겠습니다 그렇기 때문에 이를 이중성 중 하는 게 아니고 그냥 데이터에 변화만 내가 중요한 그거를 우리 킴 은 부서 원들이 바로바로 확인할 수가 있는 거죠 자 그리고 좌측 위쪽에 보시면 은 쓰레드 라고 되어있는데요 쓰레드 같은 경우는 댓글이 있는 형태의 둘을 따로 확인할 수 있는 네 그런 형태라고 보시면 되겠습니다 자도 보기 에서도 뭐 일제 하는 항목들을 따로따로 확인 하는게 아니고 한 번에 네 확인 할 수 있고 오키타 내용들이 있다고 보시면 되겠습니다 처음에 슬랙 에 가입하실 때는 우리가 일반적으로 접했던 5 카카오 똑같은 메신저 와 조금 다르게 생긴 ui 에 대해서 약간 거부감이 드실 수도 있고 어렵다 라고 생각할수도 있는데요 사실 메신저를 한번 이상 써보신 분들은 1 이 30분정도 이렇게 메뉴들을 한 것이 눌러보고 막상 해보시면 은 어렵지 않게 사용하실 수 있습니다 개인들이 사용하는 메신저의 경우에는 최 사 를 하거나 혹은 이직을 하거나 아니면 실사 운이 입사했을 때 그 전에 대화 내용을 확인할 수도 없고 그 다음에 내보내기 기능 도 잘 되지가 않죠 자 하지만 이렇게 업무 역 메신저의 경우 잔디와 마찬가지 도 내보내기 그리고 기존의 히스토리 들을 바로 확인할 수 있는 그래서 인수인계 도 굉장히 좋구요 그 다음에 최 사 처리를 하기에도 굉장히 주 은 그런 업무용 외신 저라고 볼 수 있겠습니다 그리고 스마트폰에서는 동일한 이름의 어플리케이션이 있기 때문에 pc 와 거의 동일하게 또 스마트폰 혹은 태블릿 pc 에서도 사용을 하실수가 있습니다 다시 결론적으로 말씀드리면 우리가 일상적으로 사용하고 있는 메신저를 사용하는 경우에는 업무와 일상이 분리가 되지 않기 때문에 정말 중요하고 급한 메시지를 놓친 다던가 혹은 불필요한 것들을 계속 보게 된다 던가 그런 식의 낭비 들이 생겨날 수 있게 되는데요 이렇게 업무와 일상 을 분리해서 이 메신저 조차 내 커뮤니케이션 쪽 조차도 이렇게 분리해서 사용한다면 처음에는 일이 많은 거 같고 불편 하다 라고 생각하실 수 있지만 시간이 지나면서 오히려 더 효율적이고 시간을 단축시킬 수 있는 그런 방법이라고 바바 충분히 느끼실 수 있을 거라고 생각이 됩니다 자 이번 시간에 여기서 마치겠습니다 감사합니다\n",

카카오톡 단체 방을 친구 기를 써서 아져 단톡방 음 그런 개념인데 회사에서는 친구 낄 수는 단톡방 한 재미 있는게 뭐냐면 특별한 주제가 있는건 아니에요 그저 친한 친구끼리 뭐 어울려서 그냥 떠들고 놀고 놀고 놀고 하는 거죠 회사에서 쓰는 팀 치즈 조금 다른게 일단은 같은 그룹의 사람들이 있어도 나중에 다른 사람이 그 팀 체 들어올 수가 있어요 근데 어떻게 해야 얘길 해야 될까 전혀 다른 두 토핑을 한방이 되게 할 수도 있는데 같은 그룹 끼리 그 사람들이 전혀 다른 토픽을 각 토핑 마다 방을 하나 만들어서 얘기할 수도 있죠 이거에 장점은 뭐냐면 나중에 만약에 요 토픽에 필요한 사람이 하마 여기서 들어와야 되는데 다른 토핑이 난 들어야 될 때 그 사람은 역을 들어오는 회복되어야 할 수 있다는 거예요 뭐 그래 스카이프 전 msn 이었고 그런 대화방 쓰시는 분도 있었고 근데 이제 그런거에 단점은 그거죠 시 스토리 찾기가 힘들다는 건 나중에 들어온 사람들은 과연 무슨 이야기가 오고 가는지 모르고 일어나는 거 그래서 최근 들어서 어 뭐라 그럴까 침체 예전에 처음 시작을 제가 볼때는 페이스북 처럼 뭐 뭐지 이에 뭔가 그런 서비스가 있었거든요 회사를 위한 페이스북 계속 못 같은 구름 만들어서 거기 얘기하고 이런걸로 하는것 같은데 뭐 그건 모바일 쪽으로 별로 좀 별로 였으니까 그들의 나온게 옛날에 icq 같은 대화방 알죠 아니면 무슨 뭐 옛날 하이텔 같은 경우는 대화방 같은거 있었고 그런 식으로 그냥 icq 같은 경우엔 채널 이름 있고 그 채널에 3대 들어서자 이렇게 얘기하고 icp 단점은 히스토리가 안보이는거 있지만 그런 icq 비슷한 식으로 대화방을 이제 좀 더 모던하게 만든 서비스가 2억에 있어요 첫번째가 이제 10 채식 5 두번째가 슬래그 줘 저도 시체스 회사에서 처음 도입했을 때 조금 써봤는데 이건 도입하는 과정이 좀 문제가 있어서 별로 안 썼고 저도 별로 마음에 안 들었고 왜냐하면 사람들이 스카이포스 지 말고 무조건 입체 마우스 라 그래서 왜 다 3사 스카이프 쓰는데 그리고 사람도 쉽게 쓰다가 다 스카이프 돌아가는데 이런 것도 있었고 그 다음에 최근에 제가 써본 가 슬랙 이구요 자국 개념은 맞다는 거에요 한마디로 대박 만들어서 사람도 왔다갔다 하면서 보는 뭐 들어 들어오고 싶으면 들어오나 53 때 아가고 당연히 비밀 되어야 방이 있고 당연히 뒷말 하는 것도 있고 아 그런데 다 장점은 그거 좋아 이 쉽게 란 똑같지만 모든 히스토리가 남고 모든 히스토리 검색할 수 있고 기타 등등 일단 17:00 나 슬랙 이나 기본적으로 공짜에요 물론 제약은 있죠 뭐 17:00 나 이런거 같은 경우에는 무슨 뭐 최근 메시지 몇 만개 까지만 검색이 가능하다 던가 뭐 아니면 뭐 뭐 그게 가장 큰 제약이 고요 사실은 그리고 두번째로 이제 슬랙 은 제가 써 오면서 되게 요즘 많이 쓰고있어요 쓰면 되게 좋은게 뭐냐면 3 그 유저 중에 두 가지 모드가 또 있어요 3가지 모든 데 개나 줘 기본적으로 회사 아이죠 그 모든 대화방 만들어갈 수 있는 거 페이를 대방 안내서 두번째는 게스트 이 줘 그래서 이 게스트 저는 두가지 그만이에요 계속 처리한 방 하나에 만들어 올 수 있는 계속 드리죠 아니면은 방 몇개만 골라서 여기만 갈 수 있는 게스트 줘 한마디로 우리가 왜 줄거나 그럴 때 이외 주는 사람이 이 방에서 사람들 고대 와야 될 때 그렇게 하나만 연결을 넣을 수 있다는거 이거는 단점은 첫 번째 유저 빼고 나머지는 그 돈 내는 아 회사만 쓸 수가 있어요 4 돈 과금 체계가 한 유저 당 얼마 기 때문에 회사가 면에 100명의 유적 5 제가 유저 당 한달에 얼마 지 기억이 안나는데 뭐 이래서 이 분이라 그러면 한달에 20만원씩 해야 되는 거예요 그러면서 이 왜 왜 뭐라고 외주 유저들을 쓸수 있는거죠 근데 외주 유저들은 공짜에요 그렇게 들어오면 그래서 실제 회사 비용만 내면 되는거고 썩 저는 기본적으로 일단은 꽁짜로 쓰고 있고요 제가 지금 다니는 회사에서 17일 쓰고 있는데 뭐 그건 그렇지만 27도 안좋아하는 이후 슬랙 에 비해서 슬랙 의 모바일 플랫폼의 훨씬 깔끔하고 훨씬 잘 되어 있고 또 장점은 슬랙 은 아 여러회사 카운터로 연결이 가능해요 도메인 달아 가거든요 뭐도 매닉 뭐 예를 들어서 다 슬랩 닷컴 그러나 페가 제가 원하는 도메인을 만들 수 있어요 그럼 포프 tv 나 쓸래 딱 거의 이런식으로 그런데 이제 만약에 제가 나중에 따른 목포 포레 디오를 만들고 싶다고 퍼프에 대해 슬랩 거 만들어서 같은 어카운트 그 같은 프로그램에서 카우스 위치하면서 볼 수 있는 장점이 있어요 그리고 뭐 요즘 흔히들 하는 뭐 ifttt 있잖아요 ex 텔 텐데 그래서 이제 뭐 서비스 여기서 이런 일이 일어나면 따른 서비스 이렇게 뭐 연동할 수 있는 거두다 연동되고 어 뭐 여러 가지 용도를 써보니까 굉장히 좋긴 좋더라구요 그냥 기본적으로 icq 1 회사 내부의 r 시키고 어 물론 대화 내용은 서쪽 서버에 저장이 되니까 뭐 그런거 신경 쓰시는 분들은 조심하셔야 했고 서치 기능 왠만한건 되고 이미지다 붙이는거 되고 이렇게 넘봐 되는데 단점은 돈을 한다면 최근 몇 만개 까지만 볼 수 있다 제가 앞에서 아까 그 얘기 했잖아요 저희 회사 히피 해서 들어왔는데 저희 회사 사람들 잘 안쓰는 이유 제가 지금 일주일 한번 나가는 해서 그 이어 사실 그 거였어요 이 슬랙 이라던가 17:00 라던가 이게 도입된 배경 그리고 얘네가 내세우는 게 뭐냐면 회사 같은 경우가 이제 굉장히 좀 펫에 적인 분위기도 하잖아요 이제 우리는 우리 팀 4 사람들 얘길 하지 그 위에서 어떤 결정이 이런 지 모르고 어떻게 이런 일이 를 모르고 아무도 모르는 거에요 그런거를 그냥 사람들이 비밀 쳐서 말하고 아니면 개인 채 비밀로 안 하려고 하게 되며 어쩌다보니 케인 채 그럼 우린 아무 것도 모른 채 그냥 우리는 모회사 결정에 뭐 어떻게 돌아가는지도 모르고 아무것도 모르고 그런 미치다 그래서 이제 실리콘 밸리 쪽에서 아 우리 좀 더 열린 회사 그저 투명한 회사를 만들자 그런 의미에서 모든 회사의 위해서 내는 결정 같은걸 좀 알려주고 싶고 이유가 문제가 알려주고 싶고 걔네들이 뭐 이렇게 8 뭐랄까 밑에 사람들이 참여하고 싶은 찬호 + 해주자 한마디로 뭐 열린 회사 뭐 열린 정보 같지만 뭐 그런 개념으로 하려는 쉬러 였어요 그래서 그런걸 잘 드는 판 회사들에서 는 그 뭐라고 굉장히 다 정말 비밀스러운 얘기 빼놓곤 아무래도 비밀스러운 얘기할 수도 있잖아요 회사에서는 근데 회사에 따라 무슨 뭐 이런 재무제표를 공개하는 경우도 있으니까 직원들한테 제가 얼마 벌고 있는지 그렇게 좀더 공개된 열리는 살아 만들고 싶어하는 그런 ceo 들이 줄줄이 되서 아니 온몸의 이 적극 들이 주축이 되서 그런거 를 시작하면 사람도 자기도 참여 하니까 좋고 그런 식으로 이렇게 진행을 해왔던 건데 저희 회사에서는 어떤 식으로 좀 진행이 된다면 모든 대화 팀 간에 그 팀 내부의 대화가 저희 스카이프 그렇제 에서부터 이루어졌어요 그걸 계속 이론 굇수 없었고 그리고 어찌 보면은 뭐라 그럴까 회사에 대한 불만 같은거 때들이 쉽게 그런데서 얘기를 하거든요 얻고 우리만 아는 거니까 이제 그런거 했는데 저희 회사에서 이제 17 을 막 푸쉬 했던 매니저는 지가 모든 t 채 3 다 들어가 있었어요 그래서 이렇게 한마디로 애들을 지켜보다 느낌이 굉장히 가 있거든요 그래도 그걸 싫어서 결과 같더라 그게 전부에요 오히려 그 매니저 스킬이 얘기하는 책 채 3 애들이 들어가서 봐야 되는 건데 오히려 이런 그런 공개 채팅방 2 메이저가 애들이 무슨 말하는지 보게 되면 그런게 되고 걔들은 그걸 별로 좋지 않게 어 그니까 뭐 메이저 에 대한 불신이 기도 했겠죠 그것때문에 들이 점점 멀어졌던 거거든요 이제 애들이 스카이프로 돌아가니까 막 너넨 왜 저래 채 왜 이고 17 안쓰고 스카이프는 여고 뭐 건너 막 따지고 막 이런 이런 이상한 현상이 있었어요 결국 그 매니저 알렸지만 그래서 이제 제가 그것들이 했거든요 사람들 안쓴다고 뭐 하는 사람 그래서 이 이런 이럴때만 쓰다 분들이 뭐 여러가지 문제가 있었죠 그 제가 볼 때는 그게 가장 컸던 것 같아요 사실은 그래서 이러한 오픈 대화 채팅 시스템을 도입할 내면 물론 아까 말했지만 비밀 책방 도 만들 수 있어요 그래서 그걸 갯수 되면서 상관없지만 검색되고 뭐 그런거 좋아하는 사람들 그리고 모 으 가끔 없잖아 얘기 하고 난 다음에 이메일 지역의 무슨 얘들아 이런것들 똑같은 마음 이유로 채팅방에서 하면 좋잖아요 그런것도 그런거 필요한 사람들 좋은거 같고 저도 그래서 그냥 침 쳐도 이제 좀 슬랙 덜 되게 여름 괜찮게 보고 많이 쓰고 있는데 넓게 쓸 일이 없어요 왜냐 전환 따른 이라고 인해 새 내면을 쓰는 게 전부고 그래서 그냥 예전부터 그런거 있었거든요 채팅 만 하나 있으면 좋겠다 사람끼리 모여서 그냥 아무 신경 없이 아야 모카 뭐랄까 비탄 사람이 많았던 oic 기체 이런거 이젠 icq 가 뭐 보안 문제도 좀 있고 이런거 때문에 조금 귀찮고 프로그램도 모바일 것도 좀 그렇고 그래서 안썼는데 슬래그 로마서 아 이거 좀 해봐야겠다 싶어서 포프 tv 슬랙 을 만들었어요 그래서 포프 tv 채팅 많이 지금 있어요 읽기는 상단 숙면이 나 지금 15명 있나 별로 중요한 얘길 안 하는데 사실은 때는 그럼 랜덤 방에서 주로 떠들고 잡담 방에서 그런거예요 그래서 아 예전에 트위터나 페이스북에 말하긴 말했거든요 제모 슬랙 4tb 채 트로 오고 싶은 사람들이 있으면 그냥 저한테 이메일 주소 알려 주면 이메일 주소가 있어야만 가입이 되요 뭐 그것도 제가 어찌 보면 약간 좋아하는 걸 수 있어야 아무나 와서 그냥 무명으로 떠드는 것보다는 그래도 자기 이름 걸고 떠드는 사람들이 보통 책임감있게 따지는게 말아서 그래서 그것을 만들었고 뭐 틀어지고 싶으신 분들 있으면 저한테 뭐 댓글 달아줘 되고 e 메일주소를 알려주시면 그럼 제가 초대 그 써드릴께요 이게 원래는 회사 단위로 쓰는 거기 때문에 뭐 무제한 유저 까지 0 짜긴 하지만 이런 식으로 오픈 대화방 으로 쓰는게 과연 어떻게 해야 되는지 모르겠지만 뭐 뻗 조합해서 tv 커뮤니티 라고 얘기하고 뭐 주로 이거 보시는 분들은 게임에 관심이 있거나 프로그램은 관심이 있거나 그런 분들이기 때문에 또 아니라 밴쿠버에 사시거나 뭐 그냥 떠들면서 놀면서 제가 볼 때 지금 대화방에 뭐 합의 한 대와 1 5주 올라오나 뭐 것은 나쁘지 않죠 그냥 떠들고 놀고 그런 마음으로 쓰고 있어 궁금한것은 3때 물어보고 그 모 뭐 가입하고 싶으신 분들은 그냥 댓글 달아주는 해요 가입하시면 되구요 즉 숍에 보내드리면 되니까 그냥 뭐 그렇게 쓰면서 테스트 해보시는 것도 나쁘지 않고 회사에서 슬랙 같은거 도입하고 싶은 분들은 쉽게 타고 슬랩 중 슬랩 중에는 슬랙 을 도입할 시길 바라고 그리고 도입하는 과정에서 아까 말씀드렸듯이 메이저가 누구로 관찰하는 게 아니라 그 반대로 직원들이 회사에 참여할 수 있다는 그런 분위기로 주는 훨씬 좋은것 같아요 암 포프 였읍니다\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: 예전에 되게 오래 저희 줘 슬랙 이라고 제가 팀에서 쓸 수 있는 채팅 플랫 폰 그리고 꽁짜 져 에 꽁짜로 쓸 수 있는 그런 플랫폼을 소개 했었어요 그러면서 뭐 포프 tv 슬랙 빵도 그때 한번 얘기를 했었고 그리고 실제 2 앱이 굉장히 앱 이라고 해서 라 이 서비스가 굉장히 커 졌죠 미국에서는 거의 슬래그 로 안도는 팀이 있을까 생각을 할 정도로 굉장히 커졌고 그 이제 예전에 한번 모 회사의 회사 이제 투명성을 유지 한다거나 직원들한테 아 그리고 모든거 에 이제 좀 최대한 이제 그 문서와 된 예 기록을 남겨서 누가 실수 하더라도 뭐 책임도 지 분묘 아고 괜히 뭐 서로 모옌 이 책임있는 내 책임인 싸우지 않고 그냥 빨리 인정하고 넘어가는 것으로도 좋단 얘기 됐어요 그래서 저도 이제 뭐 어 그리고 또 팀이 이제 뭐 리모트 로 일하는 팀이 많을수록 재택근무 많아지고 이럴수록 그런게 더 중요해지는 얘기도 했었고 로 슬랙 에 굉장히 많은 것들을 이제 인 태그 레이 션 통합을 할 수가 있어요 뭐 예를 들어서 트레일러로 쓴다면 트레일러에서 슬랙 에 멧세지 모르게 할 수도 있고 못을 에게 웹 걸어갔고 별별 이상한 거다 슬랙 에서 돌게 할 수도 있고 그리고 심지어는 꽤 많은 이제 회사가 돌아가는 이제 어제 운영하는 그런 여러가지 오퍼레이션을 있잖아요 2과목 승인해야 되고 뭐 해야 되고 이런 과정들을 전부다 슬랙 에서 만들게 코딩 도 할 수 있어요 그래서 그런 식으로 굉장히 슬랙 이용해 지고 말 그대로 저희같은 이제 개발자 아니면 테크 기업의 굉장히 딱 적합한 채팅 시스템 이 되버린 거죠 그 상황이 되어 됐는데 슬랙 을 하다 보면은 이제 굉장히 좋은 기능 많고 그러지만 어쨌든 간에 뭐 이 여기서 채팅을 하고 뭐 남들 칼렌더 기능이 있어 카렌다 기능에서 밑에 같아서 잡을 수도 있고 이메일도 있고 어쨌든간에 좀 이렇게 이메일 하나만 쓸 때보다는 또 단점도 있을 순 있어요 뭐 근데 뭐 그건 중요하지 않고 슬랙 에 오늘도 이제 하다 보니까 제가 굉장히 많은 팀이 나 이제 파는 모든 모어 것들을 거의 슬랙 에서 얘기 라고 말이야 이러다 보니까 점점 슬레 게 기능들을 점점 많이 쓰게 되요 그중에서 이제 제가 되게 괜찮게 쓰고 있는 기능이 즉 리마에 리마인드 기능이에요 리마인더 리마인더 가 뭐지 나중에 나한테 알려주는 기능 이거든요 뭐 예를 들어서 구글 이제 어시스턴트 쓰면 은 이렇게 불러 갖고 야 2시간 뒤에 나 어디 가야 된다고 알려 줘 그러면 2시간 돼죠 폰에 딱 그 리마인드 뛰어 주면서 아 2시간 뒤 요거 해야 돼요 라고 말해주는 그런 기능이 있잖아요 그런 것들이 슬랙 에도 있어요 그런데 그게 되게 유용한 게 뭐냐면 트랙에서 굉장히 많은 이야기들이 오고 가거든요 마 이야기들이 오가다가 뭐 어떤 일을 어떻게 할 뻔 지단 얘기들이 나오게 되요 근데 그 얘기를 거기서 두고 끝나면 은 어차피 저는 언젠가 까 먹어요 그쵸 요거 에 관련된 얘기 또 아마 다음편 비디오 따로 할 것 같은데 어쨌든 저는 까 먹어요 그러면 내가 그걸 기억해서 나중에 확인을 해서 이 일을 우리가 해야 되니까 실제 우리 뭐 업무를 이제 트래킹 하는 프로젝트 관리 하는 그런 소프트웨어가 있을 거 아니에요 그게 뭐 비주얼스튜디오 5팀 서비스 뜬 아니면 모질 하든 무슨 트레일러 드 거기에 올려야 되는데 그걸 안 하는 경우들이 있어요 왜냐면 그 당시에는 밖에 있어 그런 플랫폼 쓰기가 불편하거나 지금 대화 열심히 하는데 이제 거기 왔다 갔다 면서 뭔가 좀 제대로 뭐 1 쓰기도 복잡하거나 그럴때 제가 하는 일이 뭐냐면 은 그 대화가 딱 나왔을 시점에 그대와 옆에 쩜쩜쩜 있는 메뉴를 누르면 은 나중에 리마인드 미 나한테 나중에 언제 이걸 알려줄 지를 있을 수가 있어요 그러면 딴 리마인드 를 걸고 거기에다가 못 내가 내일 아침 9시쯤에 는 출근해 갖고 일을 제대로 할 거니 그러면 아침 9시에 리마인드 해 달라 그러면 다음날 아침 9시에 귓말로 슬랙 꽃 슬랙 로봇이 저한테 얘기해 줘요 내가 이 멧세지 오늘 9시에 얘기하다가 있었어 그럼 그때 이제 그 일 다 해결하고 다음에 클릭 한번 누르면 되요 끝났다고 클릭하면 은 리 마이너가 사라지고 아니면 그대로 두면 언제든 그 리마인드 볼 수가 있고 아니면 한 번 더 연기 하고 싶으면 더 오른쪽 버튼 한번 눌러서 점점점 눌러서 약 3시간 연기에 뭐 내일 얘기해 일주일 뒤에 말이죠 이런식으로 미 마이너로 걸 수가 있어요 그래서 이거를 잘 쓰다 보니까 저한테 주어진 일 제가 처리해야 될 일을 굉장히 많이 안 까먹게 됐어요 뭐 기본적으로 회사업무 같은 경우는 이제 뭐 그런 프로젝트 관리 하는 거에 올라가지만 개와 이제 디스코 션 막 나오고 애쓸 때 그 f 액트 오브 그 관리 거기에 곧바로 올라 가지 않았을 때 그런 경우에 리마인더 걸어두고 이제 5 내일이나 뭐 일주일에 한 번에 쭉 처리하면서 이제 프로젝트 관리 하는 프로그램의 어 그 테스 크룩 다 올려두고 컴플리트 하면 되는 거 였거든요 아니면 그런것 있잖아요 밖에서 친구 대한 술 먹고 있는데 뭐 다 비어 질문이 왔어요 답을 해줘야 되는데 가 지금 답해 주위가 좀 귀찮거나 약간 좀 얇다 해서 못할꺼 같아요 그러면 리마인드 잡고 나는 이제 술 먹으면 다음날 주고 있으니까 내일 뭐 해 알려 줘 이렇게 놓으면 그냐 술 먹어도 대화 한것도 그냥 리마인드 낚고 받으며 는 이 틀니 알려주면 아 이거 처리 해야 되는구나 그래서 그런 식으로 처리 아 가능했어요 그래서 회사에서 커뮤니케이션 하는 것을 모두 거의 모든 슬래그 로 돌리면 그렇게 커뮤니케이션 모두 슬랙 에 들어갈 땐 리마인드 가 나오게 되고 그러면 제가 처리해야 될 잃을까 먹는다는 것 자체는 아 굉장히 큰 변명이 줘 내가 바빠서 신경 0 뭐 까먹었어 라는 변명 자체가 나는 까먹을 줄 아는데 그거에 대한 대책을 안 세우는 거야 그 되게 간단한 이 되게 간단한 버튼 두번 누르면 내일 머리 나한테 리마인드 가 오는데도 불구하고 안하는거 조금 어찌 보면은 내가 내 책임을 안하겠다는 거죠 그거는 그러니까 뭐 바빠서 문제가 아니라 그냥 안하겠다는 거에요 사실 내가 안 하고 있으며 누군가 해주겠지 누군가 낳았다 중에 왔고 뭐 알려 주겠지 그럼 그때 해야지 한마디에 내 관리를 남한테 미루는 거죠 이미 자동화가 되어 있음에도 불구하고 그래서 그런 경우 에서 이제 리마인드 기는 잘 쓰니까 놓치는 게 적어 지더라구요 그리고 어떠한 친구는 저 직원 중에 하나죠 직원 중에 하나는 자기가 해야 될 모든 1 회 다해서 그것을 그렇게 슬랙 에리 마인드로 놓는 경우도 봤어요 근데 이제 리마인더 의 개념은 언제나 특정 시간에 나한테 미 마인 을 알려주는 개념이기 때문에 그리 그거는 저한테 작동 하더라구요 어떤 경우에는 그냥 투 두 리스트 에 따로 올려 두고 뭐 3달 뒤 내달 뒤에도 되는 일들이 있어요 언젠간 해야 될 일 그럼 저는 그거 너 일단 또 투 두 리스트 에 올려 두고 따른 거죠 그리고 이제 당장 시간 얼마 안에 해결해야 될 것은 리마인드 올려놓고 리마인드 뜨면 은 곧바로 그거를 알맞는 프로젝트 보드 라던가 투 두 리스트 올려놓고 1c 클로제 버리고 그래서 저는 리마인더 를 처리할 때는 모든 것을 클로제 한다 라는 긴 개념으로 가요 그걸 따른 데 적합한 4 옮기는 거 이거는 사람 따라 다른거 고 리마인더 기능의 마지막 끝판왕이 하나가 더 있어요 뭐냐 반복된 리 마이너를 설정을 할 수가 있어요 예를 들면 은 약 매주 월을 9시에 위클리 리포트 안돼 라고 나한테 리마인더 를 줘 라고 이제 커맨드 을 치면 은 그러면 매주 월요일 아침 9시 마다 슬랩 4g 알려줘야 너 나한테 매주 아침 9시의 위클리 리포트 보낸다고 알려달라 그랬어 고런 식으로 리마인드 를 쓰는 법도 있어요 그리고 어찌 보면은 요 부분을 예전같으면 은 칼렌더 에 놓고 계속 해야 됐던 것들인데 4 그 좀 되게 답답한게 칼렌더 는 기본적으로 뭐 내가 9시부터 10시 뭐 하루종일 이렇게 받으며 는 그게 리마인더 에 개념 보다는 약간 좀 그 시간 동안에는 내가 뭔가를 하고 있어 남들이 나고 미팅을 못잔다 란 개념이 좀 강하거든요 그래서 그게 원치 않으면 칼렌더 에 좌우로 저도 그 안에 모이게 빚이 바쁘다고 표시 해 줘야 되는지 딴 사람이 볼 때 아니면 잘 시간 있는거로 표시해 줘야 되는 이런거 따로 설정 해 줘서 괜찮거든요 그런걸 따지고 보면 은 우리가 예전에 칼렌더 에서 그런 식으로 반복되게 이제 리마인더 개념으로 어떤 것들은 아 클랜 리마인드 럽게 많이 해결이 가능하다 생각을 했어요 물론 이제 거의 까지 생각이 들면 당연히 이 전화기 얘들이 마이너 눌 수 있죠 똑같이 만들 수 있고 걸 쓸 수 있는데 신기하게도 저는 이제 업무 자체가 이제 뭐 전화로 많이 하지 않다 보니까 여기서 림 아이들은 잘 안 쓰더라구요 그 전 왜 그런지 모르겠어요 정말 한 두 번 써본 것 같아 저는 그것보다는 만요 개인 생활에 있어서는 그렇게 특정 시간에 모를 해야 되는 게 별로 없어서 일수도 있는 것 같아요 그럼 에투 드 리스트에 올려놓고 쓰고 있고 회사 업무 같은 경우는 슬래그 로더 니까 슬랙 이 거기 있고 이 미리 마인드를 그 메시지의 걸어 버린 버리면 그쵸 쿠로는 뭐 언제든 그 멧세지 보고 뭐 하는지 알 수 있으니까 그런 개념에서 리마인더 고여 쓰게 되더라구요 그래서 혹시라도 슬랙 쓰시는 분들은 이렇게 막 회 다 내용 막 지낼 때 내가 뭔가를 까먹을 것 같다 분명히 까먹지 사람이 얘기가 나오는데 지금 처리 못하는 것은 리마인더 만 잘 써도 어 어 이제 기계의 힘을 받아 아 이제 지털 시대죠 이제 저희가 뭔지 시대가 아니기 때문에 요건 다음 비디오에서 또 얘기할게요 그거에 힘을 받아 충분히 효율적으로 될 수 있는 것 같아요 더 이상 이제 내가 좀 뭐 꼼꼼하지 못하고 뭐 그런거 기억을 잘 못하는 성격 이어도 더이상 이렇게 크게 그것때문에 믿고 있지 않을 수 있는 세대가 온게 아닌가 라고 생각을 해요 그래서 잘 쓰시라고 슬랩 기능 이런 좋은 것도 있다 아시는분도 많겠지만 제가 요즘 특히 이제 회사의 바빠지고 이러면서 굉장히 많은 사람과 대화를 하면서 막 이야기만 내가 해줘야 될 것들이며 일주일에 몇 십 개가 되고 있을 때 그럴 때 이제 아 정말 유용하게 쓰고 있는 기능이 이거예요 그래서 그 정도로 일단 말씀을 드리고 이런 좋은 기능이 있다 슬랙 안 써보신 분들 있으면 회사의 도입하는 것 나쁘지 않다 뭐 그렇게 말씀을 드릴게요 예 뽑혔습니다\n",

책을 쓰느라 그 원고 제출하는데 조금 시간이 걸렸었고 어 그리고 사실 동영상을 업로드 할 때마다 좀 좋은 콘텐츠를 올리고 싶다는 욕심이 이제 생겨서 어 어 이게 그냥 대충 뭔가 그냥 쉬운 콘텐츠를 만드는 것보다 정말 여러분들한테 도움이 될 만한 아이디어들이 뭔지 생각을 하다가 어 계속 조금 그것 때문에 압박감이 생겼던 거 같아요 어쨌든 어서 여러 가지 아이디어를 좀 리스트업 해 보려고 했고 오늘 저희가 한번 만들어 볼 거는 이제 슬랙 회사 내의 슬랙 플랫폼 자체에 어 채치 BT 같은 이런 인공지능 LM 봇을 어 탑재시 거를 한번 만들어 볼 거예요 근데 얘는 지금 어느 정도 조금 개발 지식이 있으시면은 조금 더 빨리 이해하실 수가 있고요 만약에 코딩이 처음이신 분들은 좀 천천히 제 동영상에 나와 있는 스텝들을 따라하면서 어 코드도 제가 다 제공해 드릴테니까 그거를 복사 붙여넣기 하시면서 한번 테스트해 보시는 거를 어 추천드립니다 그래서 저희가 오늘 이제 만들어 볼 거는 이제 슬 플랫폼 위에다가 채치 BT 같은 이런 봇을 하나 탑재시킬 거고요 뭐 기능들은 정말 저희가 채치 BT 웹사이트에서 대화할 때 할 수 있는 기능들 럼 뭐 질문에 대한 답변이나 뭐 요약해 주기나 뭐 이런 것들 기능들도 한번 테스트해 볼 거고 그리고 이제 추가로 저희가 해 볼 거는 어 여러 검색 엔진을 연동을 해 볼 건데요 그래서 저희가 뭐 이전 영상들을 뭐 네이버 검색 엔진이나 구글 검색 엔진을 연했던 것 처럼 이제 슬랙봇 한테도 이런 어 구글 뭐 주식 검색 엔진이나 뭐 이런 다른 네이버 검색 엔진들을 연동시키는 방법에 대해서 한번 살펴볼게요 그래서 저희가 첫 번째로 지금 할 거는 이제 어 BS 코드라는 거를 사용을 해서 저희가 슬렉이라는 플랫폼에 탑재를 시킬 거기 때문에 일단은 먼저 BS 코드를 어 셋업을 해 줄게요네 이렇게 지금 BS 코드를 하나 켜 주시면 되고요 여기서 이제 새로운 폴더를 만들어 줄 거예요 그래서 여기다가 어 오픈을 누르고 저는이 새로운 파일 만드는 거를 해서 여기다가 슬렉 봇이라고 이름을 짓겠습니다 슬렉 보이라 하고 얘를 이제 오픈을 누르면 저희가 방금 만든 폴더로 이렇게 들어오게 되고요 여기서 저희가 이제 할 거는 어 슬랙에가 봇을 탑재시킬 건데 그 코드가 이제 파이썬 코드이고 요 그리고 파이썬 언어로 되어 있는 파일들을 실행시키기 위해서는 가상 환경을 어 실행 시키셔야 됩니다 그래서 하나의 가장 환경을 만든 다음에 그 환경 안으로 들어가서 거기서 이제 파이썬 파일을 실행시키시면 되고요 지금 저 같은 경우에는 맥북을 사용하고 있기 때문에 만약에 어 저는 이제 어네 맥북을 사용하고 있는데 만약에 이제 윈도우 환경을 사용한다면 조금 셋업 환경이 조금 달라지고요 그거 를 셋업할 수 있는 방법은 제가 어 예전에 이제 노션 글로 작성한게 있어서 그거를 참고하시면서 가상 환경을 한번 실행시켜 주시면은 될 것 같습니다 그래서 일단은 저는 이제 맥북이 여기서 이제 가성 환경을 실행시키는 방법은 일단 새로운 터미널을 연 다음에 여기 이제 아래에네 이렇게 새로운 터미널이 열리고 저희가 방금 만든이 슬랙 보라는 파일 안에 들어오게 되잖아요 여기서 이제네 새로운 가상환경을 만들 위해서는 저는 파이썬 3를 사용하고 있고요 만약에 윈도우시트 대이 만든다이 뜻이고요 이런 가상 환경 V를 만들고 저희는 그 가상 환경의 이름을 그냥 VV 하겠습니다 그래서 이렇게 하면은 지금 이제 왼쪽에 이런 가상환경이 하나 어 만들어지는게 보이실 거예요 만약에 안 시면은 다시한 한번 환경이 다를 수도 있으니까 그걸 한번 확인해 보시고요 그리고 일단 이런 걸 만들기 전에 꼭 파이썬 3가 어 다운 받아져 있는지 한번 확인해 보시고 이걸 만약에 내 깃 터에다 연동시키고 싶다 그러면 연동 시키시면 됩니다 그 연동시키는 방법도 제가 이제 밑에다가 댓글에다가 그 링크 방법들을 좀 공유해 드릴게요 그럼 일단은 이제 왼쪽에서 이런 가상 환경을 하나 만들게 됐고 저희는 이제이 가상 환경 안으로 들어올 거예요 그래서 들어오는 방법은 sce VV been acate을 하시면 지금 옆에 이렇게 어 bnv 괄호가 하나 생겼잖아요 이게 생기면은 지금이 가상환경 안에 들어왔다라는 뜻이고요 어 윈도우 유저시 아마 좀 이런 식으로 실행시키면 될 거예요 BB 하고 스크 하고 이렇게 하면은 얘가 아마 가상환경 안으로 들어오게 될 겁니다 일단은 저는네 맥북 환경이어서 이렇게 들어오게 됐고요 저희는 그다음으로 이제 슬렉 보을 이렇게 연동시키는 그러니까 그 슬렉 봇 자체에 어 LM 기능을 탑재시킨 그런 코드 파일을 하나 만들 건데요 일단은 여기 왼쪽에서이 새로운 파일 만들기 버튼을 누르신 다음에 여기다가 뭐 셀렉 보 .py고 하시면 됩니다 그러면 이렇게 새로운 파이썬 파일이 만들어져요 일단 이런 파일을 만들기 전에 저희가 이제 어떤 거를 활용해서 만들 거냐면 슬렉 볼트라는 패키지를 사용을 할 거예요 그래서 이거는 지금 슬랙에서 어 개발자들을 위한 다큐멘테이션 페이지에 다 있기 때문에 그거를 지금 한번 살펴보면서 어떤 식으로 만들면 될지 한번 보겠습니다네 이거는 현재 이제 슬랙이 개발자들을 위한 이런 다큐멘테이션 하나 만든 건데요 저희가 볼트라는 패키지를 사용을 해서 이 슬랙에 체포를 탑재시 위해 이런 패키지를 이제 사용하게 될 겁니다 그래서 지금 여기서 지금 게링 스라는 애를 누르면은 기본적으로 이제 어떻게 하면은 얘를 활성화할 수 있는지이 가이드가 지금 다 나와 있어요 어네 지금 일단 영어랑 일본어는 있는데 한국어는 없는 거 같네요 일단은 설명을 드리자면 저희가 가장 먼저 해야 되는게 워크스페이스 내에서 어떤 앱을 만들 건지 그러니까 그 앱 자체를 일단 먼저 만들어 줘야 됩니다 그래서 그 앱을 만들기 위해서는 제가 이제 그런 어 앱을 만들 수 있는 권한을 갖고 있어야 되겠죠 그래서 회사 내의 워크스페이스 면은 일단은 뭐 이런 앱을 탑재시킬 수 있는 권한을 갖고 계시면은 이거를 만드실 수가 있고요 만약에 슬래 뭐 워크스페이스가 없으신 분들은 그냥 새로운 워크스페이스 만들고 여기서 새로운 앱을 만드시면 됩니다 일단은 그냥 쭉 한번 설명을 갈게요 그래서 뭐 어떤 식으로 얘가 지금 진행이 되는지 설명을 드리자면 저희가 가장 첫 번째로는이 앱을 만들어야 되고요 그 앱을 만들면서 저희가 이제 받을 수 있는게 필요한 이런 유저 토큰이란 봇 토큰을 받을 수가 있습니다 그래서 저희가 어 만약에 채치 피티를 호출하고 싶을 때 그 필요한 API 키 그 비밀번호를 항상 갖고 있어야만 얘가 아 내 이제 계정이 지금 오픈에 출하고 있다 이런 걸 알 수가 있잖아요 그래서 마찬가지로 이런 앱을 만들기 위해서는 유저 토큰이란 봇 토큰 두 가지가 필요합니다 그래서이 두 가지 토큰을 사용을 해서 저희가 파이썬 코드랑 슬렉 봇을 연동을 시킬 거예요 그래서이 두 가지를 사용을 하고요 얘네를 이제 받으면은 얘가 이제 단계별로 이렇게 만들 수 있는 거를 굉장히 쉽게 설명해 놓고 있어요 일단은 저희가 방금 이제 BS 코드에서이 황이 환경 가상 환경을 만들어 줬고 저희가 이렇게 지금 실행 시키기까지 했잖아요 그래서이 환경이 스텝은 지금 일단 끝난 거고 그다음에 이제 저희가 해야 되는 거는이 슬보 토큰이 슬 앱 토큰을 받은 다음에 그거를 어 비밀번호 파일 안에다가 넣어 주시면은 됩니다 그래서 저희는라는 새로운 비밀번호 파일을 따로 저장해 놓는 그런 파일을 만들 거고요 그래서 이렇게 하신 다음에 이제이 필요한 슬렉 볼트 패키지를 다운을 받고 그리고 이제이 코드를 여기다가 이제 저희가 아까 만들었던이 슬보 .py 아는 파일 안에다가 넣으면은 됩니다 그래서이 코드에 대해서 잠깐만 설명하자면 얘는 이제 굉장히 쉽고 그냥 이렇게 필요한 패키지들을 불러오고 있고 그리고 가장 처음에이 앱이라는 거를 일단 먼저 활성화 해 줘야 돼요 그래서이 슬렉 보 토큰이란 애를 사용을 해서이 앱을 활성화 하면 됩니다 그래서 일종에 얘가 서버 역할을 하는 거고 슬랙에 저희가 예를 들어서 이렇게 메시지를 보내고 이렇게 보내면은 그 메시지를 받아 와서 그거에 대한 답변을 생성해내는 거를이 슬보 py 아는 코드가 하게 될 겁니다 그래서 그렇게 만드시면 되고요 뭐 실행시키는 거는 그냥 파이썬 3 뭐 앱 다 py 이런 식으로 하면 됩니다 일단 중요한게 뭐냐면은 얘가 이제 어 메시지를 이렇게 한번 보냈을 때 예를 들어서 내가 뭐 테슬라 스톡에 대해서 검색을 해 줘라고 이렇게 물어보면은 얘가이 메시지를 받을 수 있는 그런 함수를 하나 만들어 줘야 돼요 그래서이 메시지를 받고 그거에 대한 답변을 생성해내는 함수를 저희가 만들어 줘야 됩니다 그래서이이 함수가 뭐 이런 식으로 예를 들어서 만약에 사용자가 뭐 메시지를 헬로라 보내면은 이거에 맞게 이런 식으로 어 안녕이 유저 이름까지 이렇게 호출시 뭐 안녕하세요 해림 님 이런 식으로 답변하도록 이런 함수를 하나 만들어 주면은 슬렉 플랫폼 내에서이 봇한테 헬로라 보낼 때마다 이런 답변을 받게 되는 겁니다 그래서 일단은 정말 간단하게 이런 식으로 이제 코드를 셋업할 수 있다라는 거를 흐름을 보여 드렸고요 그러면 얘를 이제 본격적으로 만들 거기 때문에 저희가 이제 다시 돌아와서네 그래서 저희는 일단 새로운 앱을 만들고 걔를 이제 워크 스페이스 자체에 하나 탑재를 할 거예요 새로운 앱을 만들기 위해서는 지금이 링크를 통해서 지금이 부분이 보이면 여기서 이제 초록색 크리에이트 앱을 누르시면 되고요 이거를 어이 링크를 지금 제가 댓글에다가 이따가 달아 드릴게요 그래서이 링크를 타고 들어가서이 create a Pre configured 앱이라는 거는 일단 기본 설정이 설정들이 어느 정도 이제 탑 탑재된이 앱 템플릿을 바로 만들 수가 있어서이 링크를 활용을 해서 새로운 앱을 만들겠습니다 그래서 여기서 크레이트 앱을 누르시면 되고요 여기서 이제 저희가 어 탑재시킬 워크스페이스를 정해 주시면은 됩니다 그래서 저는 스타트업이라는 워크스페이스를 선택을 할 거고요 이제 넥스트를 누른 다음에 지금 일단 기본적인 얘가 할 수 있는 기능들이 여기서 이렇게 다 일단 기본적으로 탑재가 된 거고네 뭐 설정들이 이런게 다 됐고요 여기서 지금 저희가 제 이름을 수정을 해 줄게요 그래서 여기서 뭐 예를 들어서 gptp 이런 식으로 하시면 됩니다 이건 그냥 지금 이름만 바꿔 준 거예요 그래서네 이렇게 이름을 바꿔 주면 GPT 보시라고 되고요 방금 그걸 한 방법은이에 configuration 아는 버튼을 누르고 GPT 보 이름 부분만 바꿔줬습니다 얘를 이렇게 바꿔 주고 난 다음에 크리에이트 버튼 누르면은네 이제이 화면으로 넘어오고 저희가 이제 어 베이식 인포메이션이 데에서 일단 먼저 앱의 토큰을 먼저 발급을 할게요 그래서 여기 앱랩 토큰이란 데로 내려오면 되고 여기서 이제 제너레이 토큰이 버튼을 누르시면은 됩니다 그래서 토큰 이름은 그냥 테스트로 하시면 되고 여기서 이제 몇 가지 기능들을 얘가 좀 할 수 있도록 어 스코프를 추가해 주셔야 되는데요이 버튼을 눌러서 뭐 얘가 쓰고 뭐 읽고 나머지 기능들도 할 수 있도록 몇 가지를 다 추가해 주겠습니다 그래서 이렇게 추가해 주시면 되고요 얘를 이제 생성하는 초록색 버튼을 누르면 이렇게 복사할 수 있는 앱 토큰 비밀 번호가 하나 생성이 되죠 그래서 얘를 지금 복사를 할게요 카피 버튼 눌러서 복사하시면 되고요 다시 이제 BS 코드로 넘어와서 저희가 아까 이제 처음에이 파이썬 파일이랑 슬랙을 연동시킬 때 앱 토큰이란 비밀번호를 사용을 해서 연동을 시켰어요 그래서 그거를 지금 방금 복사했다 그거를 따로 이제 비밀번호 파일에 저장을 해 줘야 되기 때문에 저희가 새로운 emv 아는 비밀번호 파일을 만들어 주겠습니다 얘로 이제 들어오시면 방금 이제 다운받은 복사한 그 앱 토큰을 슬 앱토큰이라는 이름으로 이렇게 운표 사이에다 저장해 주시면 되고요 이제 얘를 이제 저장을 하면 되시고 저희가 이제 다시이 화면으로 이제 넘어오면 일단 앱 토크는 완성이 됐고요 얘가 이제 아직은이 GPT 보이라는게 이제 슬랙을 보시면 아직은 지금 연동이 되어 있지 않아요 이건 제가 이제 예전에 만들었던 거고 얘를 이제 워크스페이스에 어 다운을 받아 줘야 됩니다 그래서 에서 부분에 work 버튼 누르시면은네이 접근 권한을 이렇게 허용해 주시면 되고요네 그러면 얘가 이제 스라는 버튼이 뜨고네 제 이제 슬랙으로 들어오시면 파풀 앱이라는 애가 하나 하나 생성이 됐습니다 얘네는 일단 잠시 삭제해 줄게요 얘네 다 삭제하고 똑같은 이름이긴 한데 지금 얘가 이제 저희가 방금 만든이 새로운 앱입니다 지금 보시면은 얘한테 지금 메시지를 보낼 수가 없잖아요 그래서 얘한테 이제 메시지를 보낼 수 있도록 그 기능을 한번 활성화해 줄게요 그래서 그 기능을 이제 활성화하는 방법은 저희가 이벤트 스크립션이라는 데를 들어가시면 됩니다 그래서 사이드바에서네 여기로 이제 좀 들어오시면 여기서 subscri to B이라는 데가 하나 있어요 그래서 얘를 이제 클릭을 하시고 지금이 기능이 하나 활성화되어 있긴 한데 얘가 앱 멘션이라도 셀렉해 예를 들어서네 예를 들어서 여기서 이제 저희가 아까 만들었던이 파풀 앱이라는 맨션을 하고 뭐 하이를 하면은 여기서 이제 얘가 답변할 수 있도록 그니까이 어 호추 기능 이거에 대한 답변만 할 수 있도록 한 건데 저희가 이제 추가로 원하는게 뭐냐면 얘한테도 이제 개인적으로 DM 메시지를 보냈을 때도 얘가 이제 답변하도록 설정을 할 거예요 그래서 그걸 하기 위해서는 여기서 ADB user event 누르신 다음에 메시지라는 거를 치시면 지금이 메이라는게 하나 뜹니다 그래서 얘를 이제 클릭을 하시면 얘는 이제 다이렉트 메시지 개인적인 메시지를 보냈을 때도 얘가 이제 그거에 대한 답변을 할 수 있도록 하는 거예요 그래서 일단 이렇게 하시고 저장을 해 주겠습니다네 그래서 이렇게 해 주시면 되고요 저희가 좀 다음으로 해야 될게 뭐냐면네 앱 홈으로 사이드바에서 앱 홈이라는 데를 들어가신 다음에 여기 밑으로 좀 내려가시면 저희가이 기능을 을 하나 활성화할 거예요 그래서 이거는 메시지를 이제 봇으로 이제 바로 보낼 수 있도록 또 허용해 주는 거여서 얘도 이제 체크를 해 줘야 메시지를 보낼 수가 있습니다네 슬랙을 한번 이제 껐다가 다시 켜면은 지금 이런 식으로 얘한테 이제 메시지를 보낼 수 있는 이런 창이 하나 이제 뜨게 됩니다 그래서 이런 식으로 저희가 기능을 하나 다 어 메시지도 얘한테 다이렉트로 보낼 수 있도록 지금 활성화 해줬습니다 저희가 이제 다음으로 해야 되는게 뭐냐면네이 어라는 데를 들어가시면 아까는 이제 앱 토큰을 받았지만 이제는 이제 봇 유저 토큰도 한번 받아야 돼요 그래서 여기로 들어오시면 지금이 토큰을 하나 복사하실 수 있는게 있고요 얘도 마찬가지로 카피를 한 다음에 얘를 이제 복사를 하셨으면 다시 이제이 비밀번호 파일로 들어오신 다음에 여기다가 슬 보 토큰이 하겠습니다 이렇게 하고 방금 복사안 애를 붙여 넣어 주시면은 돼요네 그래서 이렇게 하시면 되고요 그다음으로 이제 저희가 본격적으로이 파이썬 파일을 하나 만들어 줄 거예요 이거는 제가 이제 이미 이제 만들어 놓은게 있어서 그 코드 파일을 보면서 같이 이제 설명을 드리겠습니다 네 그래서 지금이 코드를 같이 볼 건데요이 코드는 이제 어 어떻게 했냐면 저희가 맨 처음에 이제 설명드렸던 그 슬랙 볼트라는 패키지를 사용을 해서 어 얘에 대한 이제 답변을 좀 핸들링 할 수 있는 이런 함수들을 만들어 줄 거라고 했잖아요 지금 함수 자체를 이제 몇 개 두 개 정도 이제 만들어 놨고 일단은 맨 처음에 저희가 이제 볼게 뭐냐면 얘는 지금 일단 그냥 필요한 패키지들을 불러 오고 있고요 지금 저희가 여기다가 이제 llm 기능을 탑재시킬 거잖아요 그래서 오픈 AI 호출해서 오픈 AI API 질문을 보냈을 때 그거에 대한 답변을 생성할 수 있도록 할 겁니다 그래서 그러기 위해서 지금이 필요한 패키지들을 지금 불러 왔고요 저희는 랭 체인이라는 거를 이용을 해서 하나의 llm 체인을 만들고 그 체인이 사용자의 질문에 대해 답변할 수 있도록 할 겁니다 그래서 일단은 가장 지금 이제이 코드 자체는 60줄 밖에 안 되고요 얘를 이제 설명을 드리자면이 12번째 줄에 있는 여기가 저희가 이제 비밀번호 파일에서 저장했던이 슬랙봇 토큰 있잖아요 걔를 활용을 해서 지금이 앱 자체를 지금 여기다가 연동을 시켜 준 겁니다 그래서 연동 자체를 여기서 해 줬고요 그다음으로 이제 필요한게 뭐냐면이 llm이라는 자연어 모델을 하나 만들어 줄 거예요이 LM 만들 저희는 오픈 AI 제공하고 있는 챗 오픈 AI 아는 모델을 활용을 해서네이 lml 만들 거다라고 여기서 이렇게 알려주고 있고요이 처는 0이랑 1 사이에서 0에 더 가까우면 조금 더 형식적인 답변을 내놓는 거고 1에 가까울수록 조금 더 창의적인 답변을 내놓습니다 그래서 이거는 뭐 소수점 짜리로 0.5 0.2 이런 식으로 설정해 주시면 되고요 그래서 일단은 이런 램 하나를 만들어 줬고 그다음으로 이제 저희가 할게 뭐냐면이 템플릿을 하나 만들어 줍니다 그래서이 템플릿은 그 프롬프트 자체를 여기다가 이제 넣어 주면 돼요 그래서이이 설명은 그냥 지금 어이 슬렉 봇이 뭐 어떤 식으로 답변해야 되는지 좀 정말 기본적으로 설명을 해 준 프롬프트 있니다 그래서 그냥 뭐 단순한 질문에 답하는 것부터 뭐 되게 다양한 뭐 설명과 토론을 할 수 있는 뭐 어시스턴트입니다 이런 식으로 제가 프롬프트를 이렇게 설명을 해 줬고요 여기서 이제 얘가 사용자의 인풋에 따라 답변을 할 수 있도록 여기다가 이렇게 알려 줬습니다 그래서 히스토리는 예전 대화 내용 기록들을 여기다가 같이 넣는 거고 휴먼 여기 휴맨 인풋은 사용자의 질문이 여기 들어가는 거고 이제 어시스턴트가 l&m이 작성한 답변이 여기다가 생성이 되는 겁니다 그래서 저희는이 방금 만든이 템플릿을 지금 보시면은이 프롬프트는 프롬프트 템플릿 함수에 여기에다가 넣어 줬어요 그래서 이걸 토대로 llm이 이해할 수 있는 프롬프트 구조로 만들어 주는 거를이 PR 플레이라는 함수를 통해서 하는 거고요이 프롬프트를 이제 만들었으면 얘를 통해서 이제 본격적으로 llm 체인을 만들 수가 있습니다 그래서이 llm 자체는 저희가 위에서 설정한 이 챗 오픈 AI 만들겠다라는 거를 여기서 알려주고 있고 프롬프트는 여기서 만들어 준 프롬프트를 여기다가 알려주고 있고 뭐 나머지는네이 기능들을 이렇게 설정들을 하나 추가해 줘서 챗 GPT 체인이라는 거를 하나 만들게 됩니다 그러면 저희가 얘를 이제 어떻게 활용을 할 거냐 얘를 이제 저희가이 핸들링 할 수 있는 함수를 두 개 만들어 줬는데이 두 개의 함수가 뭐냐면은 일단 처음엔이 앱 멘션이이 앱을 어 호출을 했을 때 아까 이제 골뱅이 표시하고 파풀 앱 하면은이 앱이 호출이 됐잖아요 그래서 그 앱을 맨션 했을 때 어떻게 대답을 해야 되는지 여기서이 함수에서 이렇게 알려 주고 있는 거고 그리고이 함수는 그냥 얘한테 어떤 메시지를 보내든 그니까이 별표 표시가 그냥 모든 메시지를 다 뜻하는 거거든요 그래서 어떤 메시지를 보내든 이거를 이렇게 이런 식으로 답변을 해라라고 이렇게 알려주고 있습니다 그래서 지금이 함수를 조금 더 자세하게 살펴보면은 얘가 이제 사용자가 앱 맨션을 하고 메시지를 보내면 그 메시지를 바디라는 데에 저장을 하고요 그리고 거기서 그 텍스트만 추출해 와서 걔를 메시지라는 변수에 저장을 하게 됩니다 그래서 그 메시지를 휴먼 인풋이라는 데에다가 넣어 주는 거예요 그래서 그 휴맨 인풋이네 넣어 준 다음에이 저희가 위에서 만든이 채치 PT 체인 테 보내게 되는 겁니다 저희가 아까 프롬프트를 만들 때 휴맨 인풋을 여기다가 설정을 해 줬잖아요 저희가 이제 앱을 멘션하고 뭐 예를 들어서 뭐 안녕이라고 보내면이 안녕이라는 메시지가 여기에 저장이 되고이 체인을 실행을 시켰을 때 여기다 이제 호출이 돼서 얘가이 프롬프트를 토대로 안녕이라는 질문이 왔을 때 대답을 하게 되는 겁니다 그래서 이런 식으로 답변하도록 지금 저희가 위에서 만든이 llm 체인을 하나 호출하고 있어요 마찬가지로 여기서도 그냥 똑같이 하고 있습니다 그래서 얘한테 그냥

slapping after we've taken the time to set up our stock line to our group for a height length intention we're gonna want to start working our way onto the line so in order to do this I'm gonna walk you through step by step how to get up onto your line and start walking so the first step is we're going to be straddle the line here after we've done this we're gonna bring our dominant foot my casa green on my right foot I said it in line on the line that means it straight down the line not in cross line this is the way that we're gonna balance them the next step is to look down the line don't look down on your feet but rather look down the line pick a focal point somewhere down there and keep that's gonna be our where we fix our gaze the entire time it's gonna help us stabilize theirselves give us a steady point just try looking down at the line or down in your feet it's gonna be wobbling all around on you so Lena's gonna pop right steps to relax let this foot that's on the line come up into a nice steady position if you push down on it it's gonna start shaking uncontrollably so keep as much weight as you can on the ground my dominant foot on the line in line with the slack but we'll point is down the line and not at my feet my arms are up a my elbows above my head and in order to get up I'm gonna jump off my left grounded leg Chancellor that way on strike so when I sit up on the slackline you might have noticed that I kept one leg off of the line I didn't immediately put it on to the slackline I did this because it's easier to balance on one leg and it's balancing on two just because your leg acts as another weight that you can move around to help you balance on the line now learning how to walk on the slackline is entirely different from learning how to balance on the slackline the first thing you want to do is learn how to balance on that line you can do this by when just starting out standing up and balancing on one leg balance on one leg count to 10 count to 3 count to 100 just balance on that one leg when you reach that number switch your feet and bounce on the other leg do the same thing heat it again and again and again this will get you balancing on either leg practice and then as you start getting that balance down on either leg shorten that time up and next thing you know you're gonna be about walking down that line you don't ever want to rush across the slackline when you try to run across the slackline you might get a couple more steps and then just trying to move probably slowly but when you run across it that's where injuries can start happening if your hotlines a little bit higher you can catch your foot fall off taking a stand still you don't want that happening plus you're mainly just falling and catching yourself with each step you're not really bouncing or walking for that matter it doesn't really help you to run down the line so take your time one foot in front of the other and practice people do when they get on the slackline for the first times they put their arms straight out to the sides and try to balance by tipping it up and down it doesn't really help you that much what helps you balance on a slackline is having your arms up in the air and moving them from one side of the line to the other using your whole body tipping it to one side of the line to the other side shifting a leg balancing your body in different positions shifting your weight to one side of the line or the other when people put their arms out to the sides of thinking tightrope walking where they see a long pole going up and down what's happening tightrope walkers they have this long pole but they're shifting it from side to side the tipping doesn't really do all too much it's mainly the shifting of that pole from one side of the other that shifts more weight to one side or the other which is what we do but we do it with our arms as close to pull out to the sides so when you get up on the line remember to put your arms up and use your body to help stay on that line now another thing people will do when they get on the line and start taking their first steps is the surf stepping cross line a lot of surfers skaters a lot of boards where people will turn their body sideways and try to balance sideways on the line that works great for those but for slacklining we want to keep her body straight and in line so like I said earlier one foot in front of the other straight down the line not cross line another question is why is my leg shaking uncontrollably simple answer is the muscles in your leg have never had to deal with this before you have tension from the slackline shooting up into your leg muscles your leg muscles are trying to control that but because they've never dealt with this before they're not strong enough and they have no idea how to deal with it this is just something that happens and as you do it more and more it'll go away eventually your leg will get strong enough to the point where you can start pushing down on that line with your entire body weight but where do you use you go barefoot you are shoes what kind of shoes simple answers straightforward is go barefoot going barefoot is the most basic way to learn how to slackline you'll feel the line the best on your feet you'll know the placement you'll feel the placement of your foot on the line that's what you want to go for as far as shoes go having shoes is going to be harder but if you do choose to wear shoes I personally wear shoes because I do a lot of jumps a little bit more advanced tricks that if I were to do a barefoot might start wearing down on my feet so having that shoe provides some protection for my feet as far as what type of shoe I usually go with a flat thin sole type of shoe 5-10 Vibram they all make great thin sole shoes that are excellent for cycling slacklining takes time patience and practice these are the secrets to slacker there's no magic trick that you can you know pinch your nose or do something that'll up magically help you stay balanced on the line and walk down it sure snowboarders skier doesn't matter what sport you do the surfboard or you think you have great balance your balance is never been challenged in the way it's going to be on the slackline so don't get frustrated if you don't get this right away like I said it just takes practice\n",

전해드렸거든요 스쿨링 존에 대해서 얘기 좀 해달라고 얘기했잖아요 찾는 방법을 이야기해요 그래서이 영화의 여차 직접적으로 왔습니다 이때 원래라면 이게 스쿨링 조는 수십 대하고 여러 가지들이 있어요 그런데 여러가지를 얘기하기 위해서는 솔직히 뭐 많은 장소가 있는데 화목수로부터 시작해서 지금 웬만한 수도권 다 얻었습니다 그나마 얼지 않은 여차 수심이 깊은 쪽으로 와봤습니다 낚시하면서 설명해 드리도록 하겠습니다 추워서 원래 부산은 이때 물 안 합니다 12월 중순에 물이 안 얼어요 1월 달 돼야 합니다 근데 진짜 미쳤어 날씨가 와 지금 포인트 도착했는데 이쪽 구간이요 앞쪽이 동그랗게 탐을 보면 [음악] 약간의 형태가 있어요 그러니까이 수콜링에 대해서 부자가 깊은 곳이라 아니거든요 무조건 고뿌리다 그것도 아니거든요 지형 변화가 있듯이 수심이 낮아도 지역 지물 때문에 있는 경우가 있고 예를 들어 뜨거운 물이 나와서 또 고기들을 모여있는 구간도 있고요 질문이 아주 좋았어요 저는 아까 얘기하면서도 아 맞네 스클링 종 스크린이 얘기하면서도 한 번 진짜 한 번도 이런 수심 때나 이런 지형지물에 대해서 자세하게 얘기한 적은 없는 거 같더라고요 그래서 오늘 자세하게 한번 설명하려고 합니다 3G 프리리그입니다 4인치 따지고 그만큼 라인을 빼면서 없으신 체크를 하면 되고요 수심이 일정하게 있다가 갑자기 기뻐질 구간들이 있어요 그런 곳이 소원 유지도 편하고 조금만 이동해도 수심이 낮은 곳으로 올라갈 수 있기 때문에 그런 것을 좋아합니다 그래서 겨울철에는 조금 이런 펌프 약간 이렇게 파져 있는 곳이나 지형 짐을 변하는 곳을 체크해야 돼요

깊은 곳은 물이 덜 얼기 때문에 추운 겨울에도 낚시를 할 수 있는 거고요 낚시 가자 했어요 가자고는 안 했어요 설명을 하면서 원래 찾는 방법을 알려달라고 했죠 와 이게 너무 추우면 솔직히 패스에 입을 갔거든요 굳이 오늘만 아니기 때문에 [음악] 여기서 손이 너무 추워서 [음악] 풀어도 써밋은 [음악] 다 풀었어요 자 이래서 겨울철엔 집에 있어야 되는데 집에 있으면 캐스팅 하고 싶어요 막상 나오면 이제 후회를 하죠 항상 그렇지 겨울철에다 느낌을 알면 좀 뭐랄까 쉽게 낚을 수가 있다는 거죠 밖에서 들어올 때는 수심 일정한데요 앞에 오면 떨어내려가 그러면 라인을 잘라주는 사람이 잘 나누는게 그 턱을 잘 탐색을 잘해야 돼 그럼 눈앞에 떨어지면 애들 바이트를 한다고 지금도 분명히 공격했어요 근데 그냥 바이트 안 하는 것뿐이에요 자궁 써야 되나 거의 바닥에 가깝게 일단 탐색은 하나 둘 셋 다섯 번 6번 7번 8번 8번 빼고 얘기할게요 제가 만약에 쓴다면 첫 번째는 무조건 리턴입니다 바닥 찍는 건 나중에고요 체크를 하고 그 다음 리티엔 폴 리티엠 폴을 한 이유는 가라앉았다가 들어줬다 가라앉았다 들어주는 이유가 밑에서 위로 올라오는 걸 반응을 하느냐가 중요한 거야 쫓아와서 때려야 안 때려요 제가 끝까지 압박을 걸렸잖아요 아빠는 뒷바늘 의미가 엄청 많다니까요 그 아빠는 뒷바늘에 걸린 거 따라서 나는 액션도 달려주고 어 얘들이 좀 따라와 선물해 하면 리트리면서 천천히 그리고 오프로드에서 잘 먹는다 아빠는 밑에서 위로 올라왔다 하면 수심대를 조금 낮춰서 떠 있는 뱃을 낚으려고 하겠죠 그래서 밑에 폴로 하면서 바이트를 하는지 체크한 후 밑에 폴더 바이트가 없어 그러면 바닥에 찍고 높여야 돼요 바닥 짚고 눕히면 얘가 와서 쫓아먹습니다 쪼아서 이렇게 완전 이렇게 쪼아 먹거든요 그러니까 그때는 이제 찍고 높이는 걸 많이 하는데 찍고 높이는 걸 제가 가이드 촬영할 때 영상을 몇 번 찍었는데 그때는 거의 전부 다 이럴 때 말이야 이거 겨울이 끝난 막바지에만 거의 놔두고 그 이후에는 리템포를 제일 많이 하고 [음악] 어 이거 무거워라 5g 7배나 [음악] 이불 [음악] 입을 다지면 뭘 갖다 줘 봐라 먹는가 [음악] 와 너무 이뻤어 지금 이게 기둥 보이나요 와 너무하다 100% 입질인데 하나도 안 까였어 스트레이트다 너희가 이거는 내가 이기는지 [음악] 물었다 물었다 자 간다 기다렸다 칠게요 오케이 [음악] [음악] 거기 있습니다 지금 제가 아까 브레이크에서 장타를 쳤어요 지금 3G 7g 가까운데부터 멀리까지 공략을 했는데요 멀리에서 조금 더 깊어지는 구간이 턱도 그래도 높지도 않아 했으니까 한 40cm 5cm 되겠네요 살짝 떨어지는데 물고 약간 싹 들어가는 거예요 혹세스를 제가 몰래 좀 기다려야 되는데 빨리 쳐버렸어 그래서 요번에는 확실하게 기다려주겠다 딱 떨어지는데 흔들어서 약간 깔딱깔딱 꾹 왔다 하고 왔다 하고 기다렸다가 이거는 왔다라고 혹시나 하는 거는 방금 같은 거는 물고 있다 이거 아니에요 물고 들어가고 있었잖아요 그럴 때는 그냥 딱 기다려 주세요 하나 둘 셋 마음속으로 한 3초만 세고 확실히 겨울날 한파가 2주 동안 지금 부산이 한파로 물이 오니까 굉장히 지금 애들이 소극적입니다 그래도 열심히 해서 낚아 냈습니다 가시죠 빠샤 아까 입주먹고 나서 몸이 아예 안 벗겨지는 거 보고 그냥 그냥 벌레같이 보이시죠 진짜 그냥 그냥 이런 거예요 너무 춥다 다시 한번 가서 어디에서 진짜 장타에서도 [음악] 자 기다릴게요 하나 둘 셋 오케이 오케이 오 힘 좋습니다 [음악] 나온다 오 힘들다 [음악] 제가 왔다라고 느끼고 최대한 죄송합니다 이해해 주세요 안 나죠 콧물 그래서 똑같이 지금 낚시하는데 그 터가 돼서 그냥 스테이저고 톡 왔다 톡이 아니에요 그냥 묵직해지는 느낌 그래서 하나 둘 셋 기다려 나갔습니다 아 사이즈 좀 더 커졌네요 자 끝날 때까지 끝난 겁니다 더 컴퓨터 닦아봅시다 가시죠 다시 한번 가보자 와 진짜 장착 때려서 핀 포인트 같이 노리고 있습니다 하나 둘 하나 딱 맞는 거 같다 이거 8m 정도 된다니까 [음악] 맞다 하나 둘 셋 오케이 [음악] 야 확실히 딱 시간이 지금 아니거든요 똑같이 낚시했는데 확실히 딱 페니셔야 되니까 먹네 먹기 시작하네 [음악] [음악] 보이시죠 지금 여기가 지금 여기가 두끼가 두껍다는 거는 주기적으로 먹이 활동 한다는 겁니다 항상 지형 짐을 먼저 찾아 가지고 체크하신 다음에 그 지형 지문에서 또 주된 먹이나 말을 하자면 굉장히 복잡한 내용인데 어떻게 보면 조금만 생각하고 접근하면 그래도 어렵진 않다는 거예요 주로 가는 포인트에서 좀 겨울철에 잘 낫길만한 거 그리고 부품 바람을 일단 이해를 해야 돼요 북풍이 정말 중요합니다 그래서 항상 북풍을 좀 피할 수 있는 곳을 겨울철에는 포인트를 선택하시는게 좋습니다이 추운 겨울날 아 서울에 지금 눈이 와서 서울 오늘 전화하니까 기세용이 영하 18도라던데 영하 16도인지 일하고 있다더라구요 겨울철에도 약간 이게 아침 저녁 먹는 타이밍이 있거든요이 타이밍이 정말요 보셨죠 똑같이 낚시하다 입자 한 번도 없다가 딱 4시 지금 20분 넘어가니까 지금 연달아 두 마리 잡았거든요 세 마리 잡았는데 지금 세 마리 빡빡 잡았는데 진짜 지금 먹고 있어요 아까는 오른쪽 제자리에 세 마리만 전혀 상관없는 턱입니다 그런데도 고기가 있다는게 아니고 아까부터 있었어 있는데 반응 안 했던 거고 이제는 반응을 하고 하는 거지 잠시라도 짧아요 아침 저녁 패딩이 겨울철에는 짧을 때 그냥 30분 잠깐 나오고 봐봐 바닥을 느껴봐요 천천히 천천히 라임아 이 정도 속도에 드래깅은 처음 해봐요 [음악] [웃음] 확실히 피딩 시간이긴 한가합니다 바닥 찍고 다시 던지려고 갔는데 턱 크기를 깜짝 놀랐어 추운 겨울 집에 잊지 마시고 포인트를 찾아서 스쿨링 줘 찾아봅시다 가시죠 조금 세분화되게 나눠서 느끼시면이 라인으로 간단한다 간다 약간 이거는 그냥 일반적인 드래깅이라기보다 느낌이 그 하시는게 약간 그렇죠 살짝 살짝 흔들면서 바닥에서 근데 이제 확실하게 쉬어질 때는 터가 내에서 학생 쉴 때는 그냥 과감하게 더 쉬어야 돼 그냥 놔둬야 돼 가만히 스테이를 좀 노려줘서 볼 수 있게끔 근데 일반적으로 그렇게 안 하거든 되게 그냥 빨리 하거나 느리게 하거나 호핑으로 타고 넘기거나 여기서 마무리 드리도록 하겠습니다 지금 고프로가 내 말에 추워서 배터리 꺼질 것 같거든요 솔직히 오늘 강원씨가 얘기를 하다 보니까이 스쿨링에 대해서 얘기를 한 적은 있지만 상세하게 이제 포인트에 대한 설명을 한 적이 없는 거 같아 가지고 오늘 이렇게 포인트 설명에 대해서 대충 해봤는데 오늘은 딥 있는 자리 그리고 아까 얘기했듯이 부품이 불고 여차 고뿌리가 늘어져 있으면서 조금 반한 영향이 더 덜 타고 수심이 좀 더 깊으니까 조금만 조금만 올라와도 수심이 낮은 곳에 올라올 수 있는 가까이 포진하고 있는 위치에 스쿨링을 얘기한 거고요 다음번에는 수심이 낮은 수심이 낮은 곳에서 쿨링을 한번 촬영해 보도록 하겠습니다 [음악] 오늘 자신이 자신감 있지 어제 미국에서 프로모터를 했는데 내가 개꿈이지 한 나랑 큰 성이랑 지윤이랑 3인 1조로 갔는데 이제 내가 두 번에 낚은 상태야 두 마리 났고 한 말만 더 잡으면 이제 1등 할 수 있는 상황인데 와 마지막에 그 3분 남겨놓고 혹시를 미스하네 분명히 꾸민 거 아는데 근데 포인트도 요새 추워서 그런지 온천이야 뜨거운 걸 나와 감자 잡았거든요 아 나 그 보면 얼마나 웃었는지 아쉽게 하면서 야 날씨가 추워서 맨날 그런 뜨거운 물 얘기하니까\n",

듭니다 지금 워낙 변동성이 3조 구조 으 막 3% 예 저 장소 뽕짝 나가니까 저는 베타 였기 때문에 예 자 그렇게 보면 될거 같고요 그래서 5 너무 내년에 대한 어떤 전망을 세세하게 세우기에 는 아직까지도 명확하게 보고 있는 것 같지가 않아요 자 그렇게 보면 좋을 것 같고요 여기서 명기는 편하게 내 마음대로 하니까 그저 h 재미있었다 아 아 에 지난 번에 이어서 한국 그 기술 주에 어 변화 이거에 대한 레포트를 계속 소개했는데 이걸 이어서 계속 해보면 좋을 것 같습니다 2분의 어 내용이 좀 괜찮으니까 저번 시간에 이어서 이제 적에도 위성에 대한 스타일 스타 저 테슬라의 스타 링크 그리고 이제 뭐 아마존의 블루 오리진 뭐 기타 유럽의 예 4 퇴사 희림 갑자기 l 일이 뭐죠 원우회 원외 뭐 이렇게 되어 있는데 이거에 대해서 설명을 하는데 어쨌든 이 기술의 확산에 대중과의 벽을 넘 넘는 경우는 소위 말하는 인프라 연결이란 충매 3가 만날 때 가속화된다 어 그 연결의 는 뭐 선박은 운 하였고 자동차는 도로 였고 pc 는 인터미션 없다 지금은 이 초연결 시대 라고 좀 보고 있는 거고 적에도 이성을 그 후로 허 스 rob 씨라고 해서 에리오 라고 부르는데 이게 그 스타 링크가 처음이 아니에요 과거의 예 처음에 빌 게이츠가 마이크로소프트의 빌 게이츠가 뛰어들었다가 실패 줘 그 당시에는 약간 기술이 안되고 이렇게 쏘는 기술이 좀 부족해 쪼그리고 비용이 많이 들었기 때문에 실패했는데 이번 이게 좀 바뀌었다는 거죠 어쨌든 중요한 건 뭐냐면 이게 새로운 어떤 연결 망으로 좀 바뀌는 거고 이 끓임 보시면은 그리기를 하면 여기가 이 저희 송이 죠이 여기가 이제 800 에서 1600 키로 그래서 따지는 공간에서 이렇게 도는 거고 그다음에 이제 중중 이도 머고 의도가 있는데 대부분은 인공 이상함 여기서 있는 거죠 그 이 지구에서 보면 이렇게 되어있으면 같은 공간을 이렇게 그려보면 요 건가요 욕망 요코 만큼의 공간 이것만큼 을 공간이 잖아요 그래서 되게 빠르잖아요 그죠 공전 주기가 지금 여긴 90분이 고 여기는 24시간 이니까 통신을 할 수 있는 시간이 되게 짧죠 순간 지나가면 통신이 끊긴 은 거잖아요 이 상태에서 그렇기 때문에 상당히 많은 그 위성을 에 사진에서도 보시다시피 그냥 뛰 로 그냥 연결해서 이렇게 날아가는 게 보이는게 스타 링크 그니까 그만큼 촘촘하게 세워야 g 예 통신이 안 끊기게 쪼 그래서 많이 어 위성을 깔아야 된 으 이렇게 있고요 자 그리고 그래서 이제 위성 벤츠 2.0 이라고 하면서 이렇게 뭐 시작이 된 겁니다 그리고 지금의 여기 왜 이걸 까지 하면 나머지 금 인터넷을 연결 했던게 이젠 이렇게 54% 인 줄은 몰랐어 인터넷을 전 세계 인구의 54% 말 쓰고 있는 거죠 나머지 46% 뭐 아프리카 지역이 된 뭐 남미의 오지 등 이런 데는 사용하지 않는 못하나 봐요 46% 만 54% 그치고 있어서 지금 46% 를 차지하기 위한 요구로 좀 보면 좋을 것 같습니다 이런 내용 좀 관심있게 보시면 좋은데 그래서 뭐 태수 나 했죠 자 그러면은 기술 확산기 에 투자 적기는 언제인지 에 대해서 한번 보면 좋은데 경험적으로 여기 보시면 기술 침투 유리 정점인 50% 전우가 주가 정점인 경우가 많았다 그리고 그래서 이제 이 침투 1 이영우 에서 50% 국면에 주식투자 꽃등 기간이고 막 차 타면 아주 그냥 끝장나는 거죠 그리고 주가 성과 가장 좋았을 때는 초기 제일 초기가 성장성 때문에 가장 주가가 많이 올라 가죠 기술 대중화 직전에 단계 이렇게 오시면 되고 그 다음 만약 이제 침투 일이 10 에서 20% 가 넘어가게 되면 여기 보시다시피 기술 주도 기업의 투자를 해야 되고요 만약 침투 1 20% 가 넘어가면 1등 기업의 투자를 해야 됩니다 여기서 전기차 이야기하면서 현재 4% 때니까 전반적인 산업 전체를 지금 투자를 하고 해야되는 부분이 있고 그 이후에는 선두 기업을 해야 된다는 거죠 2023년 2 와 10% 도달 한다니까 좀 보면 좋을 것 같아요 어 전기차 산업 은 뭐 전기차 산업 이 됐든 여기 뭐 자율주행 됐든 이런 부분들이 아직까지는 침투 유리 여전히 좀 낮으니까 장기적으로 계속 뭐 좋게 봐야 되지 않을까 싶습니다 백만 배 님이 그 일단은 사용하지 못하는 지역의 좀 더 많이 사용하려고 하는 거고 3번 보완적인 역할을 하게 될 거라고 보입니다 뭐 은 안쪽이 예 이거를 그 시장점유율 가져가게 있는 좀 그렇지 않을 가능성이 있다고 보여 주고요 통신 리츠는 뭐 아메리칸 타워나 뭐 크라운 캐 스 이런 쪽은 내년에 괜찮게 볼 수 있지 않을까 싶어요 가치주 밸류 밸류 우주 식으로 내년부터는 좀 나아지지 않을까 그렇게 보고 있습니다 전연 지금 투자에도 듣지 않았다는 생각이 들어요 채림이 파괴적 혁신에 파고 되는 제목의 첫 올라옵니다 터키 3번 아님 드 그 올 한해 는 뭐 미치다 보니까 어쩔 수 없죠 솔직히 개 예 [음악] 큰 컴으로 다 깔 거 아쉽다 이 땐 뭐 퀄컴 조금있다가 종부 개별종목 이야기할 때 좀 해 보고요 음 조셉 손님이 전기차 시장 보면 충전 기술 전기차 기술 주들이 많이 올라가 있는데 주가가 만 어 미래 가치가 반영된 거 아니까 미래가치 어느정도 반영이 되어 있죠 솔직히 미래의 가치가 반영되어 있는 그런 게 있다 읽는것 사실이 조 상당히 부담스러운데 그럼에도 불구하고 계속적인 성장이 있다보니 음 어쩔수가 없는거 같아요 그런 변동성을 또 거치면서 그리고 원래 여기서 만 응 그 신사업 이다 보니까 많은 신규로 진출하는 것들이 일어나고 그 가운데 에 좀더 성장하면서 어떤 선두 기업이 나오기 시작하 겠죠 그죠 그 종자의 말한 10 에서 20% 로 넘어가는 구간의 선두 기업이 나올 거예요 그런 나머지는 탈락 하겠죠 줘 그래서 좀더 이제 에 종목 선택이 나 이런 것도 잘 해야 된다고 생각합니다 테스가 제일 빨리 앞 쓰다 보니 뭐 제일 많이 띈 미움을 받는 거고 그리고 그 발에 맞춰서 올라 가야 되는거 구조 어제 태스크 엘론 머스크가 어 이야기 했죠 여기서 성공만 삐끗하면 예 나락으로 떨어지는 이야기 했기 때문에 그대로 이제 이어져 가야 되는 부분이 있겠죠 그죠 그래서 이런 것은 김 싸움이 줘 뭐 하루에 짧은 구간의 싸움이 아니라는 생각이 듭니다 조셉 촌 님 아 괜찮아요 뭐 한국 뭐 제가 알아 들어오면 제가 말하는 걸 알아 들었으면 있으면 어 예 자 그렇고 여기까지 이제 이런 이야기를 했고요 아 이어도 나가고 아 또 나가고 얘도 나가고 어 아 자 오늘 할 거 이제 좀 이야기 해 볼게요 이거는 그냥 또 생강 된 나는 저 이제 막 쓰는거라 두서가 없어요 왜냐 알아서 좀 들어 주시면 좋을꺼 같아요 오늘의 이 디지털 디스 랩 샤넌 아니 뭐 한국말로 디지털 파괴 혁신 이런 거 잖아요 근데 이거 와 관련해서 종전의 아 크 래 프 트 에서 봤다 시피 제일 중요한 게 있어 연결이 라는 생각이 듭니다 예 큰 액티비티 가 제일 중요한 것 같아요 두번째가 이제 오토메이션 이고 세 번째가 이제 경험 네번째가 디지털 헬스 이 네 가지 예 변화가 그러나 192 후에 음 나타난 거죠 4 2 이 네 가지 변화가 계속적으로 유노 말해서 이어질 걸로 좀 보면 좋을 것 같구요 근데 이거 막 제 말을 막 썼어요 디지털 혁신 이 얼마나 빠르고 압도적으로 우리의 삶의 모든 면을 파괴한 거죠 그리고 나서 새로운 유노 말로 지금 이끌고 있는 상황이고요 그 현상이 이제 뭐 직원 재택근무 학생들의 온라인 교육 소비자 이 컨버스 엔터테인먼트 에 뭐 가상 이벤트 가상공간 이벤트 라고 하잖아요 요즘 많이 하는 bts 도 그렇고 뭐 포철 리벤스 e 스포츠 의료 자문 의 2매 덧신 뭐 이런 쪽에 변화가 있었고 자 그래서 음 이 연결 커넥티비티 와 관련되서 는 2 여기에 나오는 이 5가지는 일상 생활의 일부가 그냥 태 없다 이렇게 봐야겠죠 그죠 이제 일상이 된 사회 세상에 살고 있는 거 아닙니까 그죠 그 가운데 이제 뭐 큰 기업 중에 아마존과 넷플릭스가 승자가 됐고 그리고 연결과 관련해서 또 중요하게 봐야 되는게 미국의 이 지금 이 도시 거주자들이 그리고 뭐 기업들도 마찬가지고 약간 교회로 이전 하는 문제 이걸 고려중 인게 어 좀 많은 현상들이 인데 비용도 줄이면서 넓게 사용할 수 있게끔 이렇게 한다는데 미국 계신 분들 그런게 만인 현상이 있는지 좀 알려 주시면 좋을꺼 같아요 실제 이런거는 글로만 쳐도 보니까 실제 이렇게 되면 건축자재 건설을 쪽 이런 수애가 계속 이어지고 있는데 뭐 실제 뭐 주가 도 그렇구요 그런데 여기서 중요한 것은 음 이 사람들을 연결을 해야 될 거 아닙니까 그죠 교회로 나갔다면 이 사람들을 연결을 해야 되기 때문에 이 연결할 데이터 센터 칩 설계 하는 기업도 계속적으로 수혜를 받을 수 있다고 보면 좋을 것 같구요 두번째는 이제 워터 메이션 자동화 미라는 로봇을 생각하지만 지금은 자동화는 로보틱스 플러스 ai 인공지능 에다가 센서가 이제 포함 돼 오토미션 을 생각해야 되는데 현재 전세계 글로벌 이 물류창고 공장 에 물류창고 하고 공장의 o 에서 6% 만이 자동화가 이루어진 상태입니다 그만큼 자동화에 대한 어떤 이 성장 가능성이 어마어마하게 크죠 여전히 자동화를 실 설치할 수 있는 0 그 공간이 많은 거예요 그래서 큰 변화가 이쪽에서 예상 된다고 보고요 세번째 경험에서는 으 현실적으로 못 입는 것 부처에서 이런 볼 가상공간에서 옷도 입어보고 뭐 이런 거 그 다음에 인공 징역이 자기한테 맞는 개인화된 그 추천 해주는거 이런 증강현실 도 마찬가지죠 증강현실의 서는 화장까지 도 이제 뉴스에 하기 시작하자 나요 그렇게 좀 보면 좋을 것 같구요 네번째는 디지털 s 쪽은 뭐 다들 아 식 아시니까 짧게 설명 할 텐데 여기 중에 어 2025년까지 미국에서만 약 2500억 따라 가치가 예 디지털 s 텔레 메디슨 쪽을 형성이 될 것이기 때문에 텔레 다 같은 경우는 언제든지 조정 시 마다 좀 봐야 될 것 같고 그리고 이 메디칼 로봇 이것도 지금 60000 개 이상이 지금 추가로 어 필요한 부분이 있기 때문에 로 부 메디칼 오버 쪽도 관심있게 좀 보면 좋을 것 같습니다 예 그래서 대표 수혜주 를 4가지 예담 않는 회사는 지금 보시다시피 페닉스 없지 그 타이완 세미 컴프 tsmc 밖에 없어요 한국 주식 하면 삼성전자 까지 포함 시킬 수 있을 것 같고요 어 두번째 이 연결과 관련해서 이 두 번째 이제 오토메 이상 과 관련해서는 여러 기업들이 있죠 그런데 미국에서 찾으라면 알리바바와 상장 빈 알리 봐봐 그런데 이 오토메이션 하면은 뭐 일본 기업의 좀 더 많으니까 좀 그렇게 되면 이제 저번에 봤던 보트 있겠구나 이런 쪽도 좀 봐야 될 것 같고 그리고 디지털 헬스 쪽은 아까 말씀 드렸는데 주가가 많이 싼거 는 오는 것처럼 그래서 한국 주식 하면 그 보복과 점에서 고형 같은거 있잖아요 고영 자고 형을 되게 좋아했는데 어여 아까 지금 보니까 되게 많이 올랐더라구요 알리바바 를 꼽는 이유는 물류 자동화 jd 만큼 이제 물로 자동 아 에 있어서 상당히 그 아마존 만큼 앞서 있죠 아마존 주가를 싸고 지금 보지 않으니까 제가 말하는 것은 가격이 어느정도 지금 사면 조금 이렇게 싸게 살 수 있는 건 말씀드리는 거예요 아마존은 지금 4 상대적으로 그래서 종목을 많이 뭐 예 많이 말씀을 못드리겠네요 어 질 미니미 인구가 그렇게 많은데 굳이 물류 자동을 해야할까요 해야 됩니다 왜냐하면 이 인구 많다고 해서 인건비가 싼 것도 아니고요 어 울리자 동원해야 거기 넓은 지역을 그리고 여기에 이제 인공 진행까지 들어가서 고객이 어느 시점을 뭘 살지 를 정확하게 예측하고 그런게 다 돼야 되지 빨리 배송이 되죠 사람이 할 수 있는 일이지 아닌 거죠 이 더 이상 물류와 관련된 쪽은 사람이 할 수 있는 일이 아닌 것 같아요 자 그러면서 어제 저는 되게 이걸 인상깊게 봤는데 어제 시간이 짧아서 그랬는지 이거 있죠 이거 딘 마인드에 단백질 접힘 현상 해결 전에는 이거 보면서 어마어마한 산업 확장 가능성을 봤거든요 줘 4 근데 이제 뭐 예 포기 나름 이겠죠 지금 신약 개발이나 모든 분야에 있어서 이런 쪽으로 모든 산업 이루어지면 인공지능을 뭐 각자 자기만의 뭐 슈퍼컴퓨터를 하는게 아니고 클라우드 이룰 필러 살수 있잖아요 거죠 그런것도 좀 생각해봐야 하는데 아 그리고 재지 님은 아 들어온 들어오니 현실화되면 좋겠죠 그죠 아크 에서도 바라보는게 이제 뭐 들어온 도 있으니까 그러면 뭐 우버 도 아 그래서 우버 에 대한 아마존과 ups 플러스 우버 여기 세 가지의 물류관련 커넥션이 좀 보이거든요 그 연결의 3번 좀 생각해 보면 좋을 것 같구요 그 다음은 짧게 하면 지난 봄부터 계속 강조하지만 세스 포스 이번에 빠지는데 정말 매수 기회 같아요 [음악] 저도 지금 고민을 많이 하는데 뭐 를 세즈 포스로 바꿔야 할까 가격대가 비슷한 게 하나 있어요 그러면서 책은 축가 진짜 안 움직이는거 지금 저는 에 가격대가 비슷하면서 안 움직이는 비자를 에세이 스포츠 로 바꿀까 하는 고민을 지금은 해보는데 어쨌든 여기에 나오는 것은 그 제시한 슬라이드 기 때문에 보시면 되요 이런 지시한 자료인데 상당히 많은 돈을 주고 이제 매수 예술의 한 거죠 주당 45.8 6달 하니까 추가적으로 더 스낵이 주가가 올라가긴 이제 없는것 같고요 확대 관련 내년 2분기에 되는거고 에스맥 주 줄 하면 뭐 기다려서 받든지 아니면 신규 를 이제 스낵을 살펴본 없고 해 보죠 중요한거는 이제 워크 플레이스 협업 공간에서의 콜라보 협력이 고 궁극적인 비전 실현에 예 거의 완성 단계에 가는 거죠 저번에 말씀드렸던 클라우드 플랫폼 회사로 에 시련의 가는거고 슬랙 에 기업 고객 중 90% 가 쎈스 포쓰 닭 검에 고객과 일치합니다 그래서 음 칭 이렇게 뭐 특별한 하는데 있어서 합 씨는 있어서 그렇게 어려운 부분은 없다고 보여 지고요 에덴 i've 스 는 마이크로소프트의 막대한 악재로 작용할 걸어보고 마이크로소프트와 함께 협업 솔루션의 쌍두마차 로 좀 보는거 같구요 보시면 그림이 중요한데 이 데이터 시스템 애플리케이션 위에 슬랙 2위 딴에 이제 얻는 거죠 요 구조를 좀 잘 보시면 좋을꺼 같고 그 다음 이 뉴스에 나온 이 360도 비용에는 슬레 기 중간에 이렇게 있다보니까 이 모든 것을 제공해 볼 수 있다는 거죠 그죠 그 다음에 쓰레기 관문 역할을 하는 겁니다 모든 이 작업의 애플리케이션을 연결하는 허브 역할을 여기서 하는 거죠 상당히 시너지 가 있을 걸로 본 건데 아 원 플러스 원 에 1+1 은 이보다 이 뭐 3 이런거 보다 등치가 좀 있어서 투 플러스 투 는 5정도 4가 아닌 뭐 이 정도의 느낌 그래서 뭐 일단 통합 기구 고 이런 이야기를 쭉 할 수 있다는 것 보여주고 있구요 음 결국에는 이제 마이크로소프트 팀스 이를 말것 소프트가 팀 질을 통해서 모든 도구와 통합 하는 방식과 이제 유사하게 간다고 보시면 좋을것 같고 뭐 이 사람이 슬레 개의 ceo 였는데 여전히 2 슬랙 을 이끌 거죠 그래서 3일 스포츠 입장에서는 이 마이크로소프트 이 경쟁과 그 다음에 협업 소프트웨어 에서 어떤 그 강력한 플레이어로서 의 예 이 사람의 역할 상당히 기대가 키를 하고 있는 것 같아요 좀 긍정적으로 저는 보고 있습니다 사회 된다네 다음 빨리 하고 뭐 뒤 거 할게요 다음 2가 레몬에이드 이야기를 계속해 쬲 레모네이드를 물어봤는데 최근 흐름이 또 관심을 가져볼 만한 가격대에 같은 것 같아서 다시 한번 언급을 좀 해보면 좋을 거 같다고 생각했어요 대표적인 이제 이슈 테크 이슈 rs 의 보험과 재테크 에 만남이 줘 여기는 이제 물범 제물 보험 판매 오른쪽이 고 예 그렇다면 이제 보험료가 저렴하고 가입 절차도 이제 간편하고 책 봇을 통해서 뭐 이렇게 하니까 예 가장 현 상황에서 가장 큰 건 미국의 mi 세입자 보호 이게 매출의 90% 이상 이고요 주택 보험은 그 좀 적습니다 그리고 들어오는 보험료를 받아서 어제 봄을 들어요 그래서 상당히 낮추는 것도 있거든요 그렇다 보니까 이거 다 활용을 못하고 예 보험료 25% 만 고정 수술을 로 취득 하는 거죠 그렇게 하면서 이제 마진에 어떤 독성 추리 긴 하는데 여기가 ai 를 이용하고 빅데이터 활용 해서 보험 산업을 파괴 시키고 있다고 이제 평가를 받고 있고 1녀 게임을 최소화 시키는 겁니다 일단 전통 보험사는 에 인력이 상당히 많은데 여기는 직원 1인당 2천 3백 명 정도의 고객을 어 대상으로 이제 예 대상을 삼을 수 있고 그러니까 고객으로 응대를 할 수 있는 거죠 근데 전통 봉산 이것보다 더 3 배선을 5배 정도 어 필요 더 인원이 더 필요한 거고요 자 그 다음 이 가장 뭐 크다고 볼 수 있는게 보험의 처음 그 가입부터 어떤 심사청구 까지 의 어떤 전체 밸류 체인에 ai 가 kb 됩니다 그래서 빨리 빠른 시간내에 가입이 되는 건데 이 세입자 보험이 라서 그런 걸 수도 있고 어쨌든 빠른 가입이 되고 여기 보시면 손보사 그 손에 우리 있잖아요 손에 입을 또 어마어마하게 빨리 떨어지고 있는 상태죠 상당히 높았다 가 많이 떨어지고 있는데 현재는 미국 손보사 평균 손에 이름 보다 약간 낮은 상태구요 이게 지나 되면 더 떨어질 수 있다고 보는 거구요 자 뭐 다른걸 다 떠나서 여기서 가장 중요하게 생각하는 게 뭐냐면 이 세입자 보어 그 젊은이들 밀레니엄 3백 가 주요 고객인 데 2020년 2분기의 81만 명 가입자 중에 35세 미만 의

이 사람들을 그대로 끌고 가서 계속 함께 하면서 결국에는 에 상당히 마진이 높은 주택 보험료까지 이 생애 전체를 에 모네 드가 끌고 가겠다 이게 목표인 거죠 썸머 축가를 한번 그래서 주가 때문에 말씀을 드린 거고 최근에 이제 돌파 하려다 약간의 좀 밀리는 경향이 있었죠 왜냐하면 허재 중 때문에 좀 그런거 같아요 어 줌의 춤이 더 많이 빠지면서 200 레이

말을 못하겠어요 글로 막 설명하는 느낌보다 그리고 지금의 어떤 전기차 뭐 전기차가 막 늘어나서 주가가 올라간 다기 보다 궁극적으로는 자율 주인과 묶여서 그다음 에너지 그 테슬라는 뭐 전기차 베이스의 자유 주인 플러스 에너지사업 이잖아요 이 플랫폼을 생각하는 걸 비교 그니까 생각이 머리속에 있다보니 근데 전기차 만 생산하는 기업을 크 이런 생각이 좀 되는 거죠 예 아 아아 이런 느낌입니다 그럼 이렇게 힘 알아낸 2 향후 에 그런게 있죠 지금 [음악] 지난 10 년 동안 상당히 강하게 홈 올라왔는데 다음 10년은 그 10년 동안 올라온 시장이 그 다음 10년 동안 계속 올라갈 수 있을까 이거에 대한 논쟁 하고 똑같은 거예요 방망이를 짧게 잡으라는 것은 다 앤 홀드 전략이 안 먹힐 수 있다고 생각이 들기도 합니다 왜냐하면 금융위기 이후로 축가가 이렇게 10년도 상승할지 아무도 생각 못했죠 그리고 지금의 상황에서 는 또 10년 동안 계속 올라 갔으면 하고 좀 바램 들이 강하지만 그럴 가능성이 과연 앞으로 많이 높을까 그런 고민도 해야 되죠 구조 재민이 미 어 현재 그쵸 어떤 투자도 많이 해야되는데 이게 테슬라 이 제일 좋은건 은 시가총액이 그만큼 커졌다는 거죠 그 시가 총액이 그만큼 커졌기 때문에 그 만큼의 힘이 있습니다 그 과거 뭐 스플릿 전에 어떤 3사 $100 짜리 테슬라 와서 스피디 타부 2 지금 올라온 이 가격대의 테슬라 의 시가총액 위계 보면 그 힘의 차이는 어마어마 하게 틀리죠 그죠 예 자 뭐 상당한 이야기들이 있을 수 있습니다 조정에 대한 문제부터 에서 뭐 많은데 일단은 일단은 시장이 그렇게까지 좀전의 고평가 되어 있다 고 말해 말하지 않는 정도로 지표들이 아직까지 그 정도는 아니고 만약 금리가 어느정도 뭐 튀어 버리거나 그런게 나와야 되는 것도 있고 그리고 소위 새로운 정부의 척 초기에 대폭락 이 올 것 같지는 않아요 그렇게 내버려 두지도 않을 거고 아 조정 야머 언제든지 있는거잖아요 솔직히 개 주식시장의 뭐한 5% 이런 조정 정도는 언제든지 있으니까 그거 는 10% 까지 도 그럴 수 있죠 그 정도는 언제든지 있는 일이기 때문에 그것을 그냥 주식투자는 있어서 그냥 아 늘 나와 함께 있는 일이구나 이렇게 생각해야지 뭐 그걸 맞추겠다고 이렇게 하기에는 좀 어렵죠 그 자신이 들어갔던 투자 종목의 어 투자 기간이 짧게 준비가 됐다면 바로 빠져나오는 되는 종목들이 거구요 10년물 금리가 계속 올라가 안다고 실제 그렇게 되면 여기도 금리는 빨리 맞춘 이까 그럴 수 밖에 없을것 에 9.4 0.93 정도 올라가네요 어차 개 님 감사합니다 오늘 12월 처음 했는데 이렇게 jb 닌 테슬라 편입 되면 에 그전에 좀 오른 게 있어서 글쎄요 막상 편입되면서 넌 그냥 편하게 아니면 그날 그날 정도 한번 올라갈 가능성이 있겠죠 체디 님은 은퇴할 때까지 가져가려고 하신다고 그 좀 어 정말 그 상상대로 그러니까 향후 10년 뒤 는 어떻게 될지 모르지만 지금 우리가 뭐 생각하는 대로 세상이 그렇게 가고 그런 이렇게 나오면 테슬라 주가 도 어마어마하게 플랫폼 회사로써 지금보다 또 뭐 2배의 가치가 될 수 있겠죠 1조 달라 단어 허가는 그런 기업이 될 수도 있을 겁니다 그대로 간다면 다들 그렇게 지금의 투자자들이 그렇게 지금 보고 있고 믿고 있는 거니까요 그렇게 가슴은 좋겠네요 다들 l 아 지금의 이 테슬라가 그렇게 올라가게 되면 그 뒤에 생 그 투자에 어떤 저게 바뀌는 거니깐요 어장 시작했다고 억 이번 투자자 라고 해서 그 이 tfl 3센티 500 을 추종하는 etf 는 꼭 가져가야 되는거구요 나머지는 자기 그 테마형 etf 뭐 그런데 맞춰서 가져가는게 있을거고 아크 은

법칙 음 아 이러면서 거기에 또 자주 나오는게 항상 항상 제가 말하는 성급한 최적화는 안하느니만 못하더라 크레이그 가 뭔가요 아 이 개발자들의 특성 중에 하나가 너무 최적화를 열심히 하라는 그런 특성이 있기는 해요 뭔가 사실 옛날부터 수업 같은것 있거나 그럴 때 항상 열 번만 이 동작하는 게 가장 최적인 데 실제로 동작은 막 15번 하고 있고 이러면 그 5번 때문에 엄청 짜증나 잖아요 예 그 5번이 실제로 막 성능이 영향을 미치거나 그러진 않더라도 그런게 엄청 짜증나는 경우가 많은데 물론 저도 짜증 나오는 그런거 있어요 그래서 그거 해결 할라고 또 닭 시간 엄청 쏟다 보면 으 그런게 생각보다 또 해결이 잘 안되고 5 5 4 5 인터페이스 롭스 아예 그 말을 하려고 어떤 게 아니라 성급한 최적화를 하면 안좋은 점이 이게 최적화를 할수록 코드가 존 율현 그러니까 이 코드의 유연함과 최적화 이거를 졸다 잡을려면 엄청난 시간이 소요돼 가지고 최적화 실컷 다 했는데 뭐 회사의 기획이 바뀌어서 갑자기 에 또 새로운 코드를 짜야 된다 실컷 최적화 다 해놓은 코드 버리고 새로운 것도 짜야 된다 이러면 에 엄청 포터 라졌다 no 으 으 tee 저도 일드 점점 크게 생각이 드는게 그 막 굳이 마 어떤 언어가 더 낫다 아마 이렇게 주장하는 것도 아 아 장난 삼아서 하는것 은 당연히 그래서 예 그 개발자들이 또 막 그 개발자 유머를 좋아하니까 장 큰 삼아서 막 그렇게 말하는 것은 장난 삼아서 따른 언어 까고 막 그런거 다 괜찮은데 진짜 목숨걸고 까는 사람들이 보이잖아요 막 커뮤니티 같은데 보면 목숨걸고 나머 넣었다고 막 그런 사람들이 있는데 또 왜 그런지 모르겠어요 이렇게 갑니다 으 5 아 으 으 저는 소프트웨어 마이스토 출신 을 본 적이 없어 가지고 잘 모르겠습니다 그 뭐 하는 건지도 잘 몰랐죠 이게 이것도 맨날 제가 이게 제가 방송을 하다보면 레파토리가 똑같은거 같아요 맨날 똑같은 말 똑같은 하는거 같아서 그러긴 한데 이게 개발자 든 까 같은 그룹의 모아 나도 진짜 실력 차이가 너무 많이 나야 예를 들어 네 뭐 대기업 이라고 해도 대기업 그 개발자가 내도 실력자가 엄청나고 대학교 라고 해도 예 엄청 실력차가 다고 그러니까 소프트웨어 마에스트로 같은거 내가 어떤 거든 지 어떤 집단이 든 이렇게 다같이 모아놓으면 개발자 간의 실력 차이가 엄청 많이 나는게 나와서 소프트웨어 마에스트로 나와서 엄청 잘하는 사람도 있을 것이고 이 사람이 걸 나온 게 맞나 싶을 정도로 어 못한 사람도 있겠죠 제가 맨날 하는 말 중에 하나가 또 그 이게 1960 년대 논문으로 개발자 단에는 최대 70배 정도의 어 능력 차이가 날 수 있다 그 논문이 옛날에 나왔었다 하는거 제가 맨날 주기적으로 말씀 되자 으 그래서 기업들이 기를 쓰고 잘하는 사람을 모조리 려고 하는 게 이게 어떤 사람이 어떤 사람보다 7 10배정도 더 잘한다고 해서 70배 더 많은 연봉을 받지는 않잖아요 끽해야 하고 소질 열 배도 더 좋은 경우도 그렇게 많지도 않았고 tk 아 5배 에 3배 에서 다섯 배 능력은 엄청 차이 나는데 연봉은 그 능력도 에비 대에서 올려주는 게 아니니까 그래서 잘하는 사람을 뽑으려고 하죠 아 단순히 따져봐도 막 신이 뜰 요즘 뽑으려면 적어도 3000 4000 말도 해 주는데 신입 열 명보다 식립 10명 보면 3호 기자 날 그 3 옥주 곳 뭐 실리콘 밸리에서 데려오면 그 10명 어찌 훨씬 하고 돈암점 슬랙 클론 프론트는 렉 트랑 swr 이번에 리덕스 를 좀 떼고 리덕스 없이 어떻게 해야 어떻게 할 수 있는지 좀 대한 같은거 를 보여드리려고 하고 있는데 아 하다 보니까 자꾸 으 리덕스 같은 상태 관리 시스템이 좀 필요하다는 생각도 조금씩 들긴 하네요 5 이렇게 모델들 부터 때 내고 채널 만들기도 됐던 이게 모다 를 끄는 데 왜 상자 창이 로딩이 되냐 이렇게 생각하실 수도 있는데 그러면 똑같이 사용자 창을 분리를 하면 됩니다 이게 그리 액트 할 때 또 많이 잘못 생각하시는 것 중 하나가 이거 이렇게 빤짝빤짝 이며 안좋다고 생각하시는데 당연히 안좋은거 는 까 완전 최적의 상태는 아닌데 사실 거의 영양 없어요 그리고 실제로 이게 반짝반짝 걸린다고 해서 이 화면을 다시 드리는게 아니라 리 액트 가이 화면 쪽을 검사를 하는 거예요 이 황현희 진짜 바뀌었나 안 바뀌었나 검사 * 해도 그 검사만 해도 여기가 빤짝빤짝 버리거든요 실제로 다시 안 그리 더라도 에리 엑트 가 이쪽 바뀌어야 안 받거든요 조사하는 것만으로 또 깜짝 꺼리기 때문에 만약에 진짜 다시 그린다면 성능 적으로 전 문제가 될 수 있는데 다행히 그 정도까진 아니고 원래 이 화면을 실제로 다시 드리는게 가장 성능에서 영향을 많이 찍어 든요 그런데 그 정도를 x 가 멍청하지 않고 그냥 단순히 여기 이게 바뀌어도 안 바뀌었나 검사 외에 서안 바뀌어 냐하면 무시한 그런데 보통 이제 최적화를 하는 사람들은 어느 정도까지 원하는 거냐면 화면을 다시 안 그리는 것은 당연한 거고 아예 비교조차 도 검사 조차도 안 하기를 원해서 그런 것까지 이제 최적화를 하려는 거죠 근데 사실 저도 이게 좀 거슬리긴 해요 이거 뭐 다리를 껐는데 왜 이 예 여기 사용자 목록을 검사를 하는지 예 이런 것들 걸리니까 이런것들은 이런것들은 거슬리지 않게 하려면 이 부분을 새로운 컴포넌트로 분리를 하면 되죠 [음악] 아까 오빛나 a 어딨냐 이건가 아 이거구나 이거를 분리를 하면 될까 철수 속해서 는 고쳐야 돼요 사실 기능적으로는 다 완성이 되어 있고 쏘 km 그냥 문제만 생긴거 였으면 좋았어요 아띠 제 아버지 컴포넌트 적인 문제만 있어 그건 있는것을 좋았을텐데 소켓 알리오 귀는 문제가 생기니까 어 이거 해결 하지 마비 찾네 으 그 후기 후기 재미있게 흔들 근데 이게 후기 원래 그 함수 0 이라고 했다가 그 함수 2 진짜 향수 추종자들 한테 엄청 두들겨 맞고 함수 형에서 형을 빼고 그냥 함수 컴포넌트 록 떴었는데 옛날 원래 많은 분들이 훅 같은걸 이제 훅 자체가 아니라 그 클래스가 아니라 솔루션으로 만드는 것을 함수 형 이라고 생각하시는 분들이 많은데 이게 함수 형 이라고 하면 그 함수 용 프로그래밍 그거 를 의미 하는 거여서 함수 0 진짜 함수형 프로그래밍 하는 사람들이 리 액트 니트에 더 함수 컴포넌트가 무슨 함수형 이냐 엄청 따져 가지고 그 함수 형에서 형을 때 버렸죠 그 사이드 이펙트 검 예 애초에 그 훅 중에 i use 이펙트로 사이드 이펙트 를 쓰는거 가 있으니까 함수 향도 남기게 나죠 링크 다 까먹은 스프링 개발자 가더라도 강의할 수 있을까요 어 저는 항상 뭔가 까 먹었으면 제 무료 감자 먼저 보고 오시기를 추천드립니다 무려 감자 노드 쪽도 무료강좌 1 짧게 한 두세시간 절이 하나 내면 좋을 것 같아요 너 드뎌 가서 듣기 전에 기본적인 개념 예 아이의 뭐 예를 들어 프론트엔드 쪽 공부하다가 백엔드 로 처음 이제 프로그램인 로 나려고 하는 사람은 서버란 클라이언트 같은 개념도 잘 모르고 그럴 것 같아서 어 진짜 간단하게 설명해 주는 그런거 예 부작용 권장 형 함수 컴포넌트 넥스트 랑 리덕스 는 같이쓰기 진짜 힘들 제가 그래서 리덕스 를 떼어 있던게 저는 대부분 달 리엑터 1 때 넥스트를 쓰는데 넥스트 랑 리덕스 랑 하면 어 잘 안맞습니다 개발자 취업은 서울이랑 판교에 거의 다 몰려 있고 명봉 도 서울이랑 판교 가 높아 가지고 어 상경을 준비하시는게 좋습니다 예 예 질문좀 쌓여 있었네 저녁 상태에서 원시 값도 구조 분의 할당 하시나요 함수에 대해서 개체는 으 으 어 전 지금 승언 님 질문 2 저는 잘 이해가 안되네요 니 액트 빼서 말씀하시는건가요 근데 니트 라고 치면 저녁상 대발 비트에서 저녁 상태가 먼지가 잘 모르겠어요 그 다음에 대학생 개발자 님 질문은 방금 사실 이거 대학생 개발자 님 질문 엄청 많이 봤는데 취준생 이 구인구직 할 때 사람인 또는 잡코리아 등에서 회사 늘 볼 때 무엇을 보고 해야 하는지 이거 근데 사람보다 솔직히 다르다고 생각하는데 뭐 당장 돈이 급해서 취직한 하려고 하는 사람은 연봉을 볼 것이고 배울 게 있는지 또는 뭐 실무 경험을 진짜 뭐 체계적인 경험을 쌓았고 싶은지 뭐 이런거에 따라서 ga 그게 회사가 다르겠죠 아 그거 줘 그 지원하고자 하는 회사가 다르죠 근데 일단은 개발 조직이 좀 있는 회사가 좋고 개발 을 쪽이 각각의 개발 발견된 회사가 좋겠네요 예를 들어 유통업체 물류업체 이런데가 가 지원해 라면 어 그렇게 기술적으로 많은 걸 얻을 수 있을까 그런건 잘 모르겠어요 패션 에서나 이런데도 개발자 들 뽑기는 하거든요 예 개발자들이 뽑기는 하는데 과연 많은 것을 할 수 있을까 경험적으로 따른 해서 가는거 에 비해 도움이 많이 될 까 그런데 어떤 직종이 드 서울이랑 수도권 인한 났네 예천 얻어 그 회사 채용 많아요 저희 회사는 이제 올해는 채용을 더 이상 안 할 것 같아요 그래서 혹시나 채용 할꺼면 한밤 한번 프론트 개발자 같은거 채용할 생각이 있으면 한번 홍보 한번하면 였던 지원하지 않을까 아 맞다 그리고 4 수 있는 대로 가죠 예 신입으로 들어가거나 그러면 예 무조건 살 수 있는데요 혼자서 일하는 곳 이런데 그렇게 안 좋고 그 다음에 개발 si 쪽은 퇴사 율 엄청 높거나 이러면 안 가시는게 좋습니다 si 도 잘 가면 그러니까 막 그 3대 si 마이런 돼 있거든요 거기 가면 엄청 만족하고 또 배운 것도 많고 그런데 어 이를 먹는 에 싸이 가면 신나게 그 하청 하청 하면서 박 막 파경 거고 그런다고 하더라구요 그러면서 그 예 잡아 2명 타요 그 예 그거 있죠 유명한 짜리 있죠 진짜 그거 경험할 수 있다고 저희 그 예찬이 회사도 많이 관심을 가졌어요 적인 이미 어제 다 갖춰져 있고 어 저희 회사는 재배 사는 진짜 완전 이제 초창기 라서 좀 기복이 심한 데 저 이제 안정적이고 또 어 저쪽으로 지원하시면 예찬이 가만히 가르쳐줄 거에요

자바로 파세요 제 생각에 둘 다 아 그러니까 빽 & 에서 자바스크립트 하고 이러면 좀 어려워 넣 으로 취 노드로 신입 취업하는 것은 제가 노드 강좌를 하고 있는 입장이지만 조금 어렵습니다 신입을 잘 안 뽑아요 그래서 빽 엔드 는 자바 를 하시고 프론트로 가실거면 자바스크립트를 하세요 네슬레 클링커 딩동 자리 액트 멕스 안쓰구요 네스트 람타 이 모아 램으로 합니다 니트 네스트 타입 oil 맥스는 안써요 맥스 트랑 몹 x 도 잘 안맞아요 승천 님 안녕하세요 웹 프론트 소식이 스택 이라고 하면 어 웹 폰트는 사실 그것도 좀 필요하게 프론트 쪽 이거나 다양하다 보니까 그 회사는 좀 잘 맞아야 되는 것도 있어요 회사가 원하는 사람이어야 되는 일들은 머리 액트 에서 네이트를 하는 회사인데 당장 프론트가 급한데 뷰를 나는 사람을 데려 와서 규 하면 머리에 트 도 금방 배우니까 할 수 있겠지 이렇게 생각하는 해서는 그렇게 많지가 않거든요 니 액자는 회사는 리 액트 1은 사람을 뽑을 것이고 비유하는 회사는 뷰 아는 사람을 뽑을 거죠 4 예 저도 학교 전주 상산고 나왓습니다 네스트 도 사실 신입이 하기 조금 어렵다고 봅니다 애초에 네스트 자체가 스프링노트 같은거 하던 사람들이 잡아 쪽에서 하던 사람들이 자바스크립트 에서도 그거 비슷한 구조로 비슷한 그 장점을 물려받아서 개발하기 위해서 만들어진 거라서 사실상 경력자 들이 좀 접근하기 쉬운 플레이 뭘까요 신 잎들은 그니까 이게 신입들이 하기 쉬움 프레임워크 랑 경력자 들이 하기 쉬운 프레임워크가 좀 나눠 지는게 신입들이 하기 쉬운 프레임워크 들은 아니다 이걸 반대로 설명드립니다 예 일들은 내 스트는 왜 신입들이 하기 어려운 하면 그 폴도 부속 아 엄청 복잡하게 나누어져 있는데 그게 실제로 그렇게 해야 효율적인 하거든요 근데 그 필요성을 아직 머 신 잎들은 못 깨달아요 괜히 폴더만 많이 나누고 my 상안검 어노테이션 데코레이터 이런거 붙이고 있으니까 이런거 도대체 왜 하는 거야 정신 온 4 예 도대체 이해가 안가네 이런식으로 하는데 그래서 보통 이제 익스프레스 처럼 완전 뼈대 밖에 없는거 하면서 와 이렇게 그걸 편하고 좋은데 뭐로 네스트 처럼 폴더 구조 복잡하고 데코레이터 쓰고 이런걸 쓰지 이렇게 생각을 하자 보도 그래서 신 잎들은 익스프레스 같은거 많이 쓰고 경력자 들은 네스트 같은 많이 쓰는데 이제 그 신입들이 익스프레스 쓰다가 이제 기능을 하나씩 붙여요 ext lsl 점점 키워 나가는데 하다가 보면 왜 중복도 코드의 중복도 엄청 발생하고 그래서 이제 익스프레스 코드가 마음에 안되겠죠 그래서 그걸 어떻게 어떻게 해결 하려고 하다보니까 예 뭐 인터넷에서 이렇게 중복 제거 하는 것도 찾고 폴더 구조 잡는것도 잡고 마 이렇게 하다보면 결국에 자기가 만든게 네스트 당 똑같아 져 있어요 그거를 이미 깨달은 경력 집들은 처음에 처음부터 네스트 처럼 갖춰져 있는 걸 하는거고 크게 공감이 안가는 사람들은 xls 같은걸로 어깨도 예 네스트 필요 없어 이 스트레스로 도 답해 했다가 결국에는 아이 스트레스로 는 안돼 익스프레스로 는 되긴 되는데 이 스트레스 효율적으로 쓰려다 보니까 네스트 모양이 되더라 이것을 깨닫고 다시 끌러 가는 거예요 으 어 근데 사실 익스프레스가 그렇다고 또 나쁜거 가 아니라 네스트 도 내부적으로 익스프레스 를 씁니다 안 쓸 수도 있긴 하지만 대부분은 이태리 쓴 쓰거든요 한번 보기는 바 거에요 저는 프론트 쪽에서 swr 은 진짜 엄청 추천드리고 빽 & 도내 스트를 한 거를 추천 드리긴 하는데 네스트 가 러닝 커 보다 좀 있어요 제가 말씀드렸지만 방금 말씀 드린 건데 그 4 스에서 왜 이런 구조로 가는지를 아무리 말로 설명해도 잘 안 얻었는데 이게 실제로 경험을 해보면 편하다는 게 느껴지긴 하거든요 그래서 이게 강조하게 쫌 어려 야 그 뭐야 채용할 때 포트폴리오로 노드 버드 그 더 내가 강조해서 노드 보드 걸리지 말라고 했는데 엄청 많이 올리도록 그리고 그 바 내 강좌에서 노드 버드 올려 올리더라도 그거를 자기 스타일대로 바꿔서 올리라고 했는데 그냥 css 까지 일까요 똑같이 하는 사람도 좀 하고 저는 불능이 말했습니다 저는 분명히 너드 버드 그댄 그대로 올리면 다른 감자도 마찬가지요 좀 어 머 마 클룸 코딩하고 이런 강자들 유명 혼자 들이 많거든요 그거 강좌 들 그냥 그것을 포트폴리오로 그대로 제출하면 왜 많은 심사하는 면접관들은 다 알아요 예 그냥 강좌 그대로 베꼈다는 거 거의 다 알아가지고 친 입으로 일할 때부터 프론트 백 중에 정하고 보통 지워 낼 때 프론트 랑 백중 에 지원을 하고 가져 일하다가 정하는게 아니라 정해서 가져 그러다 중단에 바꿀 순 있어요 중간에 바꾼 사람인데 신입 때 그냥 나는 예 그래 신입 때 안전하고 뽑아주는 회사는 거의 없습니다 엑스트라의 내 스트럼 갇혀 있을 수 있습니다 저 지금 블로그를 미뉴 어를 하는데 프론트는 맥스 - 핸드는 레스트 이렇게 하려고 지금 생각 중에 넥스트 데스크 같이 쓰려고 하고 있습니다 아 이게 강좌 할 때 그 강좌를 보는 입장에서 강좌를 본 다음에 그걸로 이제 새 프로젝트를 만들면 항상 어려워 그래서 저는 추천 드리는 게 일단 강좌 기반으로 예 강좌 를 기반으로 한 채로 강좌에서 d 능을 붙여보는 것을 추천드려요 이게 강좌를 들었다 해도 아예 처음부터 다시 프로젝트를 자기만의 꼴로 하려고 하면 어렵거든요 백금 다시 백지 상태 고 솔직히 강좌를 한번 듣고 주 번 듣고 한다고 해서 그 강조해서 설명하는 것을 다 받아들이지도 힘들잖아요 그래서 그 기존 강좌를 바탕으로 거기서 기능들 수정도 해보고 추가도 해보고 하면서 그 강좌 내용을 좀 곱씹는 과정이 필요한데 조금 안타까운 건 이제 돈내고 강좌 듣고 돈 내고 하고 온거 고 하는데 예 그 돈 낸 만큼 못 얻어 가는 사람들이 좀 많다는거 그게 좀 안타까워 같아요 그러니까 한번 뭐 수업을 듣고 아 나 이거 수조에서 수료증 받고 훌훌 털어버리는 게 아니고 그걸 진짜 깨서 무려 먹어야 되요 거기서 뭔가 이런 기능 같은거 추가해 보고하면서 해야되는데 나 이거 했어 나이가 끝났어 하고 이거 터럭 그 던져 버리고 새로 이제 프로젝트 할라고 하면 아마 어정 막막할 거예요 그리고 그래서 그 저는 천을 부터 풀링을 같은거 할때 웬만하면 그거 해도 되 거지 예 맞아 포트폴리오 만들었을 때 포트폴리오도 그냥 기 톱 주소 제출하거나 뭐 스크린샷 몇개 찍어서 제출하고 이러지 말고 어차피 열심히 그 따라서 만들고 열심히 코딩하고 시 열심히 시간 쏟아 쓰면 좀만 더 시간 쏟아서 이런 부분은 뭐 이렇게 만들었고 이런거 때문에 고민을 했고 이런거 해결했다 이런걸로 도 좀 구체적으로 적으면 좋고 말씀드려 줘 그 다음에 깊어 베다가 커밋 메세지 같은거 예 그런거 마크의 124 매의 a 의 막 은 을을 이런거 아마 아무것도 쳐서 컴퓨터 좋아하시고 그런것도 다 깔끔하게 하고 이런거 디테일 디테일 하나하나가 다 캐치 가 되요 제가 면접 봤을때 지원한 사람 중에 기법의 커밋 메세지 제대로 접은 사람을 본 적이 없어요 사실 이거 근데 컴 멧세지 잘 안 적는 이유도 알겠네요 왜냐하면 커밍 메세지를 잘 적어야 되는 이유를 아직 못 깨달았기 때문에 그래서 새 카 꿀팁 을 드리는게 이건 아주 사소한 거긴 한데 커뮤 ms 지라도 엄청 잘 적어 두면 그것도 어필이 될 수가 있어요 그래요 문서와 같은거 잘 해놓고 극히 터 쓰면 리듬이 점 md 를 만들어 주잖아요 그 마크 다운 파일을 만들어 주는데 그게 괜히 있는게 아니에요 거기다 문서와 같은 거 하고 가장 첫 출발이 이거든요 그런거 자기가 포트폴리오 만든 게 있으면 거기다가 쭉 한거 정리만 해도 이 사람이 포트폴리오 그냥 단순히 패킹 게 아니구나 생각을 하면서 만들었구나 아니면 백조 없더라도 적어도 믿음이 같은데 다 정리해 둔 거 보고 이게 정리 한번 했으면 어느정도 머리에도 남아 있다는게 인상이 심어 지거든요 당연히 근데 귀찮기는 해요 근데 솔직히 취업하고 좋은데 가고 싶으면 그 정도 노력은 기본이라고 생각을 합니다 신입 분들은 거의 다 신이 뿐이 아니라 그냥 처음 입문하고 나서 깊어 베가가 이제 포트폴리오 올리고 하는 사람들은 1 백이면 99 9집 국가적 모르겠지만 95 이상은 aa 의 123 예 빈칸 뭐 이런것도 넣어요 저도 근데 독학을 하긴 했는데 제가 만약에 과거의 저한테 조언을 한다면 강의 몇 개 들으라고 할 것 같긴 하네요 저도 그 토카 때 1년 이상 시간을 예 맨날 했을 것 이것도 똑같은 레파토리 야 예 똑같은 내 터뜨리다 맨날 그 제이쿼리 얘기들을 줘 제이쿼리 랑 자바스크립트가 다른 온 줄 알고 블로그 글 잘 못 받다가 제이쿼리 배우라 자바스크립트 보다 제이쿼리 훨씬 편하 너니까 제이쿼리 배워라 라는 말에 그 초보 입장에서 뭐가 맞고 뭐가 그런 지 모르니까 홀라당 속아 넘어가서 그것때문에 1년 허송세월 했었죠 자 맨날 똑같은 말하는 거긴 한데 그래서 뭐 독학한 것도 못하면 2 또 카 캐서 잘 되면 가정 조조 돈도 안들이고 예 배 모 남 드려요 돈 들인 남자예요 똑같은 실력을 갖게 되면 좋은건데 그러기 솔직히 힘들어요 특히 프로그래밍 쪽은 처음에 엄청 헤매는 경우가 많아서 알잖아 꼬마 곰 아파 아 아까 카톡으로 뭐 선물 줬는데 모던 이제 궁금하네 근데 카톡 열면 뭐가 있을지 흘러 가지고 도 풀 풀을 예 에 솔직히 그 신입 들의 폴은 제가 그래서 안본다고 아무리 삐까번쩍하게 만들었어도 일단은 이거 베껴 쓸 거라는 의심부터 하게 되거든요 그래서 제출 만 하는게 아니라 무조건 자기가 설명이라도 조금씩 적고 이러면 예 엄청 친한 으 그 정리만 해도 뭐 뭐 자세하게 적으면 좋긴한데 정리만 해도 좋다고 생각하는게 애초에 정리 조차 안하는 사람들이 대부분이기 때문에 일단 정리만 해도 살짝 가산점이 있고 즉 애창 니가 말하는 대로 문제 해결 과정 이런것까지 적으면서 단순히 어디선가 있는 내용을 그대로 복사는 거 보다는 그 복사 조차도 안하는 사람이 대부분이지만 예 복사 하는거 뿐만 아니라 내가 이런 이거는 이런 이유로 이렇게 5 이렇게 하다보니까 안돼서 뭐 이런 방식으로 또 이런걸 시도를 해 봤고 뭐 시도해봤는데 앞으로는 뭐 이렇게 할 계획이다 또는 이를 이런게 더 나을것 같아서 이렇게 할 예정이다 이런거 적음에 엄청 좋죠 태도도 일단 좋아 보이 거 이게 요즘 입문자들이 또 엄청 많거든요 제가 이제 강추 강좌 판매되는 그것 통계가 인 프로에서 제공을 해 줬는데 그러면 입문자들이 진짜 많다고 생각을 생각이 되는데 그래서 아마 뭐 유튜브에 제 뭐 자바스크립트 쪽 검색하다가 유입 되신 분들도 많은걸로 알고 있는데 일단은 개발 쪽이 절대 만만하지 않습니다 예 공부량이 엄청나게 많아야 되고 그 다음에 여기도 거의 실력이 엄청 좌우하는 세계의 라서 엄청 노력을 많이 에요 그래서 제가 가장 그 안타깝게 생각하는 분들이 그 개발 아 요즘 개발 취업 잘 된다는데 개발이나 배워볼까 이 생각해서 들어오신 분들 엄청 좌절을 많이 겪으실 거예요 그래서 그렇게 뭐 들어왔을 수 있는데 예 괴 됐던 마음은 이제 잊어 버리고 좀 진지하게 하고 개발로 취업하는 게 그렇게 쉽지가 않다 이게 기업들이 개발자들 엄청 많이 뽑기 나는데 전제 조건이 있어요 잘 하는 개발자들을 뽑아야 예 잘 하지 않는 개발자들은 4 암 뽑을 라더라 거든요 그러니까 지금 이제 이 문자들은 엄청 많은데 반대로 기업들도 개발자 없다 개발자 없다 그런데 그 학원 같은 데 보면 개발자 마 몇 천 명씩 쏟아 지거든요 근데도 막 네이버는 개발자 없다 못 뽑게 타 카카오 도 개발자가 뽑을 개발자 없다 이러고 있잖아요 개발자를 많이 뽑기는 하는데 전제 조건이 잘 하는 예 근데 그 그래도 뭐 엄청 잘 해야 되는 것도 아닌데 제가 일까요 면접 같은거 이력서 같은것 본 입장에서는 너무 당연하다고 저는 생각하는 분들도 안하는 그런 것들이 많아서 2 개발자 취업을 너무 쉽게 보는거 가 아닌가 그런 생각이 들 정도로 라 대충 하시는 분들이 많 많아요 5 그러니까 절대 그 개발자로 취업하는 게 쉽지가 않고 5 그렇게 하고싶으면 그 정도의 좀 진지함 같은 것을 보여 주셔야 되요 그 보직 신입 입장에서 칩 회사의 신입으로 들어가려는 입장에서 실제로 사용자가 서버 서비스를 해 본 건은 진짜 엄청난 플러스 요인이 에요 강의 만 보고 강의 내용 그대로 만들고 이런거 보다는 실제로 배포를 해보고 이런 서비스를 해 보면 해봤다는 경험 자체가 엄청 플러스 요인 이거든요 제가 그래서 맨날 말씀드릴게 블로그 같은거 라도 직접 만들어서 해보면 블로그 글 보러 오는 사람들이 자기 서비스의 고객이 되는 거라고 그랬잖아요 그러다가 이제 블로그 터지면 어떻게 해결 해야 될지도 고민해 봤을 거고 그런것들 그 실제로 써비스 만드는게 훨씬 도움이 되는데 아이디어가 잘 안 떠 오시는 분들은 블로그 라도 직접 만들어 보세요 블로 그래도 직접 만들어 보고 글을 적은 다음에 페이스북 생활코딩 에다가 나 이렇게 처음으로 블로그도 만들어오고 계획을 떴었는데 그 한 번 씨와 달라 하면 사람들이 잘 와줘요 와 가서 피드백도 잘 해주거든요 커밋 생활코딩 이런 컵 adt 에서 뭐 버거 있으면 버거 있다 아니면 갑자기 뭐

공부를 자기가 선택적 으로 하게 되잖아요 예 선택적 으로 하기에 대해서 좀 편한 길로 가게 되는데 회사에서 하면 뭘 시킬지 모르고 그걸 뭐가 주어졌던 어떤 정해진 기간 안에 해야 돼서 예 진짜 뇌가 혼자 공부할 때 비산 10배 맑게 빠르게 돌게 되요 온갖 방법 생각하게 되고 온갖 그 해결책 찾아보게 되고 살짝 절실해 진다 해야되나 아니면 동기부여가 많이 된다 요즘 그 뭐라고 표현해야 될지 모르겠는데 회사에서 한달만 이래도 계획 별의별 그 인턴 소 좋은거 같아요 인턴의 보면 인턴 만 해봐도 인턴 으 인턴 할 때도 과제가 주어진 않아요 그 과제를 이제 해결해야 되고 또 상사 있고 막 그런 사람 눈치도 봐야 되고 만 이러면서 진짜 그 절실하게 코딩을 하는 개발 할 때에 막 개발 자체가 완전 이상적으로 되는 경우는 드물 잖아요 예 개발이 이상적으로 되는 경우는 드물고 거의 담아 임기응변 꼼수 같은걸로 되는 경우가 많은데 근데 그런거 한다고 봐 뭐 정도에서 것 왔다가 이런게 아니라 그런게 진짜 도움 많이 되요 어떻게서든 해결에서 잘 불러 가게 하는 인턴 같은거 경험도 진짜 좋은건 저는 차라리 처음에 해가 돈 많이 주는 뭐죠 돈을 적게 받더라도 에 당장 돈이 너무 급한 게 아니면 어이 회사 진짜 배울 게 있을 것 같다 하면 그냥 뭐 6개월 만이라도 다녀보면 진짜 도움 많이 해 봤나요 그러면 설치 중고 신입으로 하더라도 아 그럼 이제 다음 회사 갈 때 그냥 신입인 척하고 들어가면 엄청 환영 받을 거예요 행인 님께서 질문하신 게 만약에 제가 대기업 지원한다는 어떤 프로젝트 됬는데 냐 하면 그때 살집 지금 상황에서는

자바스크립트 하실 때 그렇게 크게 무리가 되진 않을 거에요 제가 원래 처음에 웹게임 강좌 를 기획해 쓸 때 어 이렇게 게임 만들어 나가다 보면 쉽겠지 해서 그렇게 강좌를 때 있거든요 근데 실제로 하시는 분들이 그 실제로 제강 그 게임 자바스크립트 강좌 를 몇 천 분이 보셨는데 가 불 맛을 매운 맛을 보셨다고 평가를 많이 하시더라구요 근데 제가봐도 좀 어려운 부분이 많아서 그걸 다시 제가 책으로 쓰면서 좀 느꼈어요 제가 이번에 4월에 책 내는게 그 외 게임 자바스크립트 강좌 책으로 나오는 거잖아요 책으로 다시 정리 하니까 이게 강좌를 찍는 것보다 책으로 할 때 훨씬 더 생각의 흐름이 체계적인 이어 지거든요 그래서 또 봤더니 아 이게 중간 중간에 좀 점프 같은게 있어 가지고 난이도가 확 확 띄는 구간이 있더라구요 그래서 제가 책에서는 좀 그 부분을 보완 하겠는데 동영상 동조를 보시면 아마 그 중간 중간에 점프하는 부분에 좀 어려우실 거에요 신임 나이는 뭐 저는 솔직히 그 요즘은 점점 더 의미가 없다고 생각합니다 사실 어린 사람을 뽑아야 될 이유가 회사의 입장에서 그렇게 많이 없어요 뭐 옛날에는 뭐 회사 한 회사의 뭐 십 년 이십 년 이렇게 있으면 당연히 나이 어린 사람 뽑아야 더 오래 있고 이런 데 요즘은 뭐 개발자들 3년마다 이직하고 이러는데 스무살을 뽑 뜬 34 를 뽑던 44 를 뽑은 3년 뒤에 우리 회사의 아니 있을건데 나이가 그렇게 중요한지 당장 실력이 있는 사람 뽑는 게 낫죠 그래서 경력 은 이전에 사기 연봉 기준 인 경우가 많아서 음 그래서 그냥 아예 신입으로 돈 많이 주면 연신 입으로 들어가는 그런게 있죠 어 저는 행위 님 그 인턴의 보는게 진짜 좋다고 생각해요 개발 쪽 인턴 하면 돼 학교에서 배웠던 게 어 대 학교에서 배웠던 게 의미가 없는건 아닌거 아냐 그런데 심도 랑 완전히 다르다는 것을 좀 느낄 수 있을 거에요 제가 말했지만 실무는 그 실제 회사에서 그거 하다 보면 진짜 별의별 그 젤 맞은 상황을 많이 겪을 수 있어요 26 27 늦은 편 아니고 저는 제가 지금 회사에서 신이 뽑았을 때 학령기 랑 나 이 아이의 안 보고 뽑 왔거든요 그리고 사실 면접 볼 때 마스크 쓰고 있어서 얼굴도 못 봤어요 얼굴도 못 보고 그냥 어 실력으로만 꼽았는데 예 39살 이 신분이 합격하였습니다 요즘 그 뉴스 살텐데 봐서 더 26 27 에 취직하는 게 평균보다 그럼 제가 봤을 때 평균 취직 연령이 막 30 가까이 됐던 것

기업들은 좀 생긴지 얼마 안 되고 그런 기업들은 나이 솔직히 거의 안 본다고 그래 개발 쪽 인터넷에서는 소주 기 어 저는 스타톡 쪽도 괜찮다고 봐야 예 si 촉 보다는 예 인터널 꿈의 si 같은 데서도 인턴을 뽑는 지는 모르겠는데 아픔을 거 같긴 한데 대기업도 따른 배울 거 있고 스타트 부터 나름 배울 거 있어 같아요 스타트업의 인턴 잘 안 뽑을 거 같긴 한데 근데 이직할 지금 연봉이 너무 적었는데 연봉 때문에 더 큰데 가려고 하는거면 사실 좀 신입이 든 신입이 든 경력이 는 별 상관없지 않나요 연봉 많이 즈는 되면 예 신입으로 들어가서 되지 않나요 사실 그 신입 짜리에 경력이 지원을 하면 안될 이유는 전혀 없거든요 회사 입장에서는 당연히 땡큐 중에 땡큐 줘 예 신이 뽑는다고 하고 그 회사 입장에서는 신입 만큼만 대우해 줄 정도로 주는데 준다고 했는데 경 역적이 조언했다 엄청 땡큐 아니에요 5 으 그런데 소켓 아 이 부분은 제가 따로 수정을 하고 아 주말에 한번 또 날 담아서 예 제 키 같은 주 주말 시간을 할애 에서 이 소켓 i 5000 얼른요 아니면 늦은 임 엄청 느리게 오는것을 어쨌든 이거는 제가 강좌로 탈 스크립트로 내외 자바스크립트 하는 사람들도

오는 거예요네 안녕하세요 이번 시간에는 어 지난 시간에 만들었던 프로모션 차트를 가지고 프로모션이 시작되는 날 하루 이전에 혹은 뭐 일주일 이전에 미리 슬랙으로 알람을 주는 걸 만들어 보려고 합니다음 저는 회사에서 슬랙을 사용하고 있어서 슬랙으로 알람을 주도록 설정을 할 건데요 아마 많은 회사에서 슬랙을 쓰고 계실 것 같아요 그래서이 영상도 어 업무하시는 분들에게 도움이 되셨으면 좋겠습니다음 일단 지난 시간에 프로모션 차트를 만들어서 구글 데이터 스튜디오 루커 스튜디오로 시각화 하는 거를 보여 드렸어요 그래서 지금 영상을 처음 보시는 분들은 우측 상단에 제가 지난 시간에 했던 영상 올려 놓았으니까 클릭하셔서 한번 보시고 그리고 구글 시트로 프로모션 차트도 만들어서이 영상을 보시면 훨씬 더 이해가 잘 되실 것 같아요 그래서 프로모션 차트 열어 주시고요 어로 데이터 형식으로 이렇게 이렇게 데이터를 누적해 나가는데 사실 여기에다가 열에 하나 더 열을 추가해서 시작일 하루 이전 날짜를 기입해 주어도 괜찮은데요 사실이로 데이터는 저는 그냥 어 정말 그 생 날것의로 데이터들만 어 누적을 합니다 왜냐하면 여기에서 뭔가를 계속 변형하고 열을 추가하다 보면이 로우 데이터에 제가 만들어 놨던 데이터들이 뭔가 깨지거나 그리고 자주 건드리게 되면 데이터가 변형되거나 이럴 수 있어서 저는로 데이터는 가능한 건드리지 않습니다 그래서 어 시트를 하나 더 추가할게요 저는이 시트 이름을 음 슬 알림이라고 기재를 해줄 거고요로 데이터에 있는 것들을 쿼리문으로 가져와서 슬 에다가 셀 알림 시에다 넣어 줄 거예요 그래서 리라고 작성을 해주시고요 데이터는 여기 쭉 다 선택을 해 주시면 되는데 a 1부터 그리고 L 렇게 행 숫자는 빼시고 a 1부터 l 설정을 해주시면음 전체가 선택이 됩니다 그래서 a 1부터 l 선택하시고 리은 셀렉트 그다음에 별 렇게 하시면 데이터에 있는 데이터들 그냥 쭉 다 가져와요 근데 만약에 어 별이 아니라 나는 로우 데이터의 채널 열 프로모션 명 프로모션 제품 그리고 할인율 뭐 시작일 종료일까지 가져오겠다라고 하시면 쿼리문을 어떻게 작성해 주시면 되냐면요 셀렉트 a b c d 열에 아까 시작이 F 그다음에 종류 g 요렇게만 가져오겠다네 요렇게 해서 가져오실 수 있어요 그리고 쿼리문은 또 나중에 뭐 예를 들어 마켓 퀄리 채널에 데이터만 가져오겠다 혹은 뭐 공기 청정기 제품에 데이터만 가져오겠다 이런 식으로 리문 셀렉트 뒤에 프롬을 써서 어 적어 주실 수도 있어요 근데이 부분은 지금 다룰 내용은 아니기 때문에 어 요렇게만 지금 적어 줄게요 그래서 셀렉트 하시고 a d 아지 그리고 FG 아지 요렇게 가져오는 쿼리문을 작성했습니다 그리고 저는 에다가 슬 알림을 줄 날짜를 여기 적어 줄 건데요 어 시작일 하루 이전 요렇게만 적어 주셔도 돼요 시작 시작일 하루 이전 그리고 저희가음 지난 시간에 제가 알려드렸던 배열 수식을 써서 요렇게 적어 주셔 도 됩니다 근데 조금 아쉬운 건 어 거예요 저희가 이제 슬랙으로 알림을 주게 되면 주말에도 알림이 가요 그죠 주말에도 알림이 가게 되면 뭔가 좀 다른 분들에게 피해가 될 수도 있잖아요 그래서 저는 토요일이나 일요일에 행사를 시작하는 프로모션을 시작하는 경우에는 금요일에 미리 알림을 줄 수 있도록 하려고 해요 사실 이제 하루 전에 알림을 주는 거기 때문에 토요일에 행사가 시작되면 어차피 하루 전이니까 금요일에 알림이 올 거잖아요 그래서 일요일에 시작되는 거면 것만 추출해서 금요일에 알람을 줄 수 있도록 설정 을 하려고 합니다 이건 어떻게 하시냐면음 문을 쓸게요 프 그다음에 위크 데이라는 함수가 있어요 위크데이는 어 월요일 일요일 일요일은 1 월요일 2 이렇게 1 월화 수목 금토 아지 1 2 3 4 5 6 7까지 해서 숫자로 변환해 주는 함수예제 제가 요걸 다 지우고 한번 보여 드리면 위크데이 하시고 어 오늘요 날짜를 한번 적어요 날짜 렇게 하시면 4라고 나오는 걸 보실 수 있죠 그러면은 이게 2월 1일이 어 일요일이 1이거나 그래서 1 2 3 4 1월 화수 2월 1일이 수요일이라는 거예요 그래서 한번 볼까요 2월 1일이 정말 수요일이 맞았는지 2023년 2월 1일이 수요일이었는데네 수요일이 맞았어요 요렇게 숫자로 변환해 주는 함수요약이 위크 데이가 위크데이요 시작일이음 1이면 위크데이 이 시작일이 1이라는 건 일요일이죠네 이게 만약에 시작일이 일요일이면 어 22 - 2 일요일 토요일 금요일 금요일이 나타나게 해주세요 금요일에 알림을 주겠다 이거예요 근데 그렇지 않으면 22 - 1 그냥 하루 전에 일요일이 아닌 다른 날에는 다 하루 전에 알림을 주겠다 어 그러면 일요일 하루 전은 토요일이어서 금요일에 미리 알림을 주도록 이렇게 설정을 했는데 만약에 월요일이라 일요일 날 알림이 오잖아요 그래서 월요일인 것도 금요일에 알림을 주게 하고 싶은 거예요 그러면 여기에 이문을 하나더 더 작성합니다 그래서 위크데이 하고이 2가 월요일은 뭐예요 2죠 일요일이 1이라고 했잖아요 1 2 3 4 이렇게 숫자대로 되니까 어 월요일이 2 그러면 2 2 - 3 월요일 3일 전 그러면은 1 토 금 금에 알림을 주세요 요렇게 되는 거예요 나머지는 E2 - 1에 그대로 주면 됩니다 이렇게 작성을 해 주시면 되고요 여기에 똑같이 저는 배열 함수를 사용하겠습니다 그러면은 22부터 2고 죄송합니다 22부터 2 그리고 22부터 2 여기도 똑같이 22부터 2 22부터 2 배열 함수를 쓸 때는 이렇게 열 자체를 하나를 통째로 다 비교를 해 주시는 거랑 열로 지정을 해 주시면 되고요 배열 함수는 어레이 포뮬러를 앞에다가 작성을 해 주시면 됩니다 어레이 포뮬러 단축키가 있어요 컨트롤 시프트 엔터를 클릭하시면 어레이 포뮬러 함수가 자동으로 나와요 그래서 요거 아주 유용하게 쓰실 수 있을 것 같습니다 클릭하시면 요렇게 나와요 근데 자가 일단 지금 숫자 형식으로 나오는 것도 문제고 그다음에 14행 터는 어 데이터가 없는데 - 1이라고 나오는게 보기 싫죠 그래서 일단은음이 시작일에 날짜가 있으면 그 데이터가 있으면 어 알림이 나오게 일단 수정을 해 볼게요 어레이 포뮬러 안쪽에다 이문 하나 쓰시고요 여기에 2 똑같이 2 2부터 2가 빈칸이 빈칸이면 똑같이 빈칸으로 나타내고 빈칸이 아니면요 뒤에 입부분을 적용해라 렇게 작성을 해 줄게요 그럼이 밑에 데이터들 없어진 거 보이시죠네 그리고 슬랙 알리미를 어 이렇게 숫자로 표현하는게 별로 보기 좋지 않아요 그래서 저는요 시작 1이랑 종료 1처럼 나오게 바꿔 주고 싶어요 물론 이어를 클릭해서요 날짜 형식을 바꿔 주셔도 돼요 근데이 형식이 간혹 틀어지기도 하더라고요 그래서 저는 그냥 안전하게 여기도 함수를 사용할 거예요 함수를 쓰는 방법은요 2 2부터 -2 그다음에 -3 -1 얘네가 이제 지금 날짜를 나타내는 애들이잖아요 그래서 여기에 텍스트 함수를 써 줍니다 텍스트 요게 요거에 형식을 yyyy mmdd 나타내 주세요 요렇게 텍스트 함수를 쓸 거예요 그럼 렇게 위에 보이시죠 01 30으로 나오는 거음 여기도 똑같이 텍스트 형식을 yyyy mmdd 똑같이 여기도 아이고 여기도 텍스트 yyyy mmdd 요렇게 작성을 해주면 렇게 바신 바뀐 걸 볼 수 있습니다네 그러면 이제 거까지는 완료가 됐어요요 슬 알림에 어 알림을 줄 거예요이 데이터는이로 데이터에서 계속해서 가져와서 여기에 자동으로 뿌려주는 거기 때문에 한번이 밑에다가 제가 테스트로 데이터를 한번 넣어 볼게요 채널을 그냥 테스트라고 적어 볼게요 테스트 그리고 나머지는 뭐 렇게 그냥 똑같이 가져와 볼게요 그리고 시작일을 28일로 한번 적어 보겠습니다 종료일 12월 31일로 이렇게 적어 볼게요 슬래 알림 복 하면 테스트 행이 자동으로 들어온 거 보실 수 있고요 그리고 슬렉 알림 1까지 자동으로 표기되는 걸 보실 수 있습니다이 배열 수식에 의해서요 아래 데이터들은 자동으로 나오게 되어 있어요 지난 시간에 말씀드렸지만이 배열 수식이 있는 행에 가는 뭔가를 작성하게 되면 오류가나요 그래서 배열 수식은 사용하지 다른 분들이 뭐 실수로라도 건들지 못하도록 여기는 데이터를 잠궈 주시는게 좋아요 그래서 시트 및 범위 보호 들어가셔서요 슬랙봇 알림의 열 지열은 음어 배열 수식이 적용되어 있다 권한 설정하셔서 나만 할 수 있게 요렇게 설정을 해 주시면 다른 분들이이 어이 여름 못 건드려요 건드이 수정하려고 하면 잠겨 있다고 나오거든요 그래서 렇게 꼭 잠겨 주시는게 좋습니다 그러면이 슬랙 알리미를 가지고 이제 슬랙으로 가서 알림이 이날 알림이 오는 걸 만들어 볼게요 이 알림은 제피라 어 앱을 사용할 건데요네 어 구글에다가 피라고

사용하는 기터 액션이 일단 있죠 만약에 액션이 없고 아무런 자동화 장치가 없다면 E2 직접 들어가서 이미지 올리고 있어야 할 수도 있을 텐데 스크립트들을 통해서 우리가 하는 배포를 좀 더 쉽게 자동화 할 수가 있었죠 그리고 비슷하게 지라 오토메이션 있습니다지라도 PR 올리고 할 때마다 티켓을 일일이 눌러서 다 최신화를 해 줘야 하나 하면 좀 괴롭잖아요 근데 우리는 그냥 피 티켓 잘 연결하면 자동화 돼서 이제 일을 깨끗하게 진행을 할 수 있습니다 좀 더 개발단 말고 사용자 단 예시로 들어가면은 채보도 있어요 그래서 뭐 여기저기서 많이 사용하는 CS 툴이죠 그래서 사람을 줄이고 좀 더 자동화하기 위해서 만드는 툴이라고 할 수 있습니다 그리고 이거는 이제 안 좋은 사례인데 우리가 공연 보려고 티켓 예매할 때 매크로 해서 이제 안표 시장이 많잖아요 요것도 하나의 보이라고 할 수 있죠 사람이 하는 업무를 이제 프로그램을 통해서 더욱더 빨리 선점하는 그런 예시입니다 그럼 봇을 대충 설명드렸는데 슬랙 봇은 무엇이냐 슬과 인터랙션을 하는 봇이라고 저는 정의를 좀 해봤어요 그래서 외부 이벤트를 슬랙으로 알림을 받고 슬랙을 통해서 외부 도구에 직접 명령도 수행을 하는 보인데 어떤 작업을 수행하는 프로그램인데 슬을 통해 에서 왔다 갔다 거리는 걸 우리는 슬랙 봇이라고 합니다 그래서 사실 봇이랑 슬랙은 좀 별개인 거예요 그래서 봇 프로그램이 있는데 그 프로그램의 동작을 슬랙을 통해서 무언가 알림을 주고 또는 명령을 받는다면 그건 우리는 슬렉 보이라고 할 수 있겠습니다 그래서 예시로 또 빠르게 쭉 훑고 가면 폴리 우리 회식 날짜 잡고 그럴 때 되게 자주 사용하는 설문 보시죠 폴리가 있고 도넛이 아고 만약에 회사에 여러 사람이 있으면 서로 얼굴을 잘 모를 때 랜덤하게 그룹을 미팅해서 자주 사용하는 도넛이랑 봇도 있을 것이고 그 아까도 지라 얘기를 했는데 지라 슬랙 봇도 있거든요 알림을 받는 것 일단 기본적으로 알림 기능이 있고 알림 외에도 슬랙 내에서 지라 이슈를 만들거나 할 수 있거든요 그래서 슬랙을 통해서 지라와 왔다 갔다 하는 인터랙션을 하는 거죠 이것도 좋은 슬랙봇 예이고 이거는 이제 뱅크샐러드 블로그에 있는 스샷을 가져왔는데 요런 사례도 있습니다 제가 전 회사죠 셀에서는 슬랙에서 맨 위에 디플로이 익스페리먼트 프로덕션 하고 커밋 차 아이디가 있는데 저거를 치면은 배포가 일어납니다 그래서 따로 액션 이제 들어가고 안 하고 그냥 슬랙에서 배포 명령 때리면 배포를 하고 아래에 스샷은 스테이터스 하고 뭔가 쳤잖아 스테이터스 하고 레포 이름을 치면은 해당 서버에 무엇이 가장 이제 최신 스테이터스를 배포가 되어 있는지 그 커밋이 나오거든요도 나오고 요런 식으로 슬레이 이랑 기업을 좀 더 자세히 연동을 해서 배포를 다 자동화하는 그런 케이스도 있었습니다 그럼 왜 우리가 슬랙이란 인터랙션 하는 보을 만들어야 하나 보이 하은 작업을 자동화하는 별도 프로그램인 건데지 예를 들어 지라라고 하면은 지라에 들어가서 하면 되죠 기터브 하고 이제 자동화 하는 거면은 기터브 들어가서 하면 되잖아요 왜 굳이 우리는 슬릭하고 인터랙션을 해야 하지 회사에서 가장 오랜 시간 사용하는 툴을 생각했을 때 어 물론 개발자분들은 그 아이디 뭐 vs 코드나 인텔리지 일 수도 있고 다른 집구 분들은 또 다른 툴일 수도 있습니다 pss 수도 있고 그런데 이제 전 사원이 평균적으로 압도적으로 가장 오랜 시간 사용하는 툴이 무엇일까 그러면 이제 저는 메신저라는 그리고 우리는 슬랙을 메신저로 사용을 하고 있죠 그래서 업무 중에 거의 항상 켜져 있는 하나의 도구로 알림을 받고 다른 도구에 간단한 조작까지 수행을 할 수 있다면 좀 더 업무가 편안해지지 않을까 그래서 다른 단어로 또 표현을 해 보면 업무 흐름이라면 개발 외에도 정말 많은 흐름들이 있을 텐데 그거를 우리 전사원이 공통으로 사용하는 어떤 하나의 툴에서 제어할 수 있다면 생산성이 향상 상상이 되지 않을까라는 생각에서 슬랙봇이라는게 이제 대두가 되기 시작을 했습니다서 여기까지가 이제 슬랙 봇에 대한 어떤 이유 만들어야 되는 이유와 설명이었는데 만드는 얘기로 넘어가 봅시다네 슬랙봇 구성도를 한번 볼게요 그 슬이는 어떤 워크스페이스 하나에 앱은 여러 개 있을 수 있거든요 그래서 왼쪽에 앱 세 개가 있죠 그래서 아니야랑 탄지로랑 고조라 이제 앱 세 개가 있습니다 그리고 가운데에는 서버 우리가 만드는 서버가 있고 오른쪽에는 우리가 많이 아는 그런 외부 서비스들이 기터브 있고 라시 서비스가 있고 항공 관련 서비스가 있어요 그래서 일단은이 정도 구성도 보면은 대략 느낌은 오는데 자세히는 모를 수 있잖아요 그래서 하나씩 한번 알아보면 일단 슬랙앱 만드는 방법부터 이제 넘어가 볼게요 만드는 방법 api.com이란게 있어요 그래서 셀렉 봇을 만들면 여기를 좀 많이 들어가야 되거든요 여러 메뉴를 다 써야 되는데 제일 우측에 유얼 앱스로 들어가면은 요렇게 메뉴들이 있습니다 상당히 친절하죠 그냥 크리에이트 뉴 앱 누르고 메뉴가 뜨면 가운데 프롬 스크래치가 있고 프롬 앱 매니페스트가 있는데 매니페스트를 하면 제이슨을 직접 써야 되거든요 그럼 어렵잖아요 우리는 쉽게 갑시다 그래서 가운데 프롬 스크래치를 누르면 가장 오른쪽 네임 앱 또는 추스 워크 스페이스라고 뜨고 저기서 적절한 값을 설정을 하면 우리는 슬랙 클라우드라는 용어는 사실 없긴 해요 없는데 제가 이해를 돕고자 만든 건데 슬레이라이드 우리 앱을 업로드한 겁니다 아직 설치하지 않았어요 그래서 아 우리가 앱을 하나 만들고 스토어에 올렸구나 근데 그 스토어에 올린 거를 아직 누구도 접근할 수 없는 상태가 가 만들어집니다 그래서 일단 앱을 업로드하는 거 자체는 엄청나게 쉽죠 뚝딱 할 수 있어요 이제 앱을 만들었으니까 뭔가 사람이 사용할 수 있게 설정을 해야 되는데 그래서 앱 들어가서 가운데 애 피처스 앤 펑셔널 그리고 인스 your 앱 딱 두 가지 하면은 이제 우리가 원하는 정도로는 사용할 수가 있거든요 가장 마지막에 매니지 디스트리뷰션 제가 해보진 않았는데 저걸 하면 이제 진짜 셀렉 스토어까지 나가서 퍼블릭하게 앱을 판매하는 그런 형태가 될 거예요 그래서 가장 먼저 첫 설정을 들어가면 기능들이 되게 많아요 인커밍 매북 슬래시 커맨드 뭐 어쩌고 저쩌고 많이 있는데 일단 다 무시하십시오 다 무시하고 가장 아래 있는 보스만 누르면 됩니다 나머지는 슬랙에 알림을 주는 다양한 방식들을 의미하는데요 이제 그 어떤 이런 식으로도 알림을 받을 수 있고 저런 식으로도 알림을 받을 수 있어 그러려면 이걸 설정해야 돼 그런 설정들이 일단 실내 자체를 최초로 사용하려면 면 보스로 들어가서 봇 유저를 설정을 해야 돼요 그래서 얼 앱프레스 인이라고 앱 디스플레이 네임이 있잖아요 그래서 우리가 예를 들어 지라라고 하면은 그 슬렉 내에서 지라라고 딱 떠 있잖아요 그것도 지라 봇 유저가 한 명이 있는 거거든요 그래서이 앱을 대표하는 슬랙 내에서의 봇 유저 한 명을 만들어 줘야 된다 이제 여기 아래 예시로는 도넛도 제가 해 추가를 해 놨는데 저 도넛도 하나의 본 유저인 거예요 그래서 저런 식으로 유저를 만들어야 된다 그리고 설치를 하면 됩니다 제가 여기에는 이제 흰 줄로 쭉 그어 놨는데 저기 유저 오어스 토큰이 봇 유저 오어스 토큰이 실제로 값이 채워져 있어요 그래서 본 유저를 만들고 나면은 토큰들이 유저 토큰과 봇 토큰이 하나씩 생기고 제가 저는 이미 설치를 한 예시를 들고 스샷을 찍어서 리인스톨이라고 되어 있지만 이제 인스톨 to 워크스페이스 최초에는 떠 있겠죠 누르면은 설치가 완성이 됩니다 그럼 이제 슬 앱을 업로드 했었고 업로드한 을 우리 어떤 특정 워크스페이스 이제 우리 같은 경우 에어프레미아 워크스페이스 있죠 그래서 여기에다가 앱을 설치를 하는 거예요 설치를 하면은이 슬랙에서 인터랙션을이 앱이 받을 수 있게 됩니다 그래서 나를 통해서 슬과 소통해라 그래서 앱이 그 가운데 브릿지 역할을 하게 됩니다 그 앱을 다 만들었잖아요 앱 자체는 방금 보여 드린 것과 같이 아무런 동작을 못 해요 그냥 셀렉으로 뭔가를 받는구나 셀렉한테 뭔가를 보내줄 수 있고 라는 그런 걸 만들었을 뿐이고 우리가 하고 싶은 복잡한 업무들을 수행을 하려면 코드가 들어가야 되거든요 코드를 만드는 방법이 여러 가지가 또 있습니다 일단 크게 세 가지가 있는데 웹북 볼트 SDK 사실 더 있어요 더 있는데 일단 제일 중요한 것만 제가 좀 남겨 놓은 거고 나머지들은 차차 알아가시면 될 거 같습니다 그래서 일단부터 한번 알아볼게요 웹은 어 웹의 정의 자체는 다들 아실 거라고 생각해요 어떤 떤 서비스에서을 하나 만들고 그 URL 호출하면 무언가의 동작을 수행해 주는 이제 그런 걸 외국이라고 우리는 부르죠네 슬 웹은 무언가 메시지를 보내고 싶으면 아래을 호출해 줘라고 해서 슬 앱에서 웹을 생성할 수 있습니다 그럼 외부 서비스에서 아 메시지를 보낼게 생겼으면 이벤트가 발생을 했어 그니까 슬에 알림 메시지를 보내 줘라고 해서 딱 메시지를 호출하면 이제 메시지가 가게 됩니다 그래서 URL 호출로 슬레기 메시지를 전송하는 거죠 그래서 엄청 쉽죠 우리가 코드를 아무것도 짜지 않고 그냥 URL 앱에서 생성한 다음에 그거를 어딘가에서 사용만 해 주면은 우리는 슬랙에 우리가 원하는 알림을 전송할 수 있게 되는 거예요 그래서 요건 어떻게 만드냐 슬랙앱 설정 들어가면 인커밍 북이라고 있어요 그래서 들어가서 온 스위치온 누르면 아래 아 이게 저 허들 저거 때문에 가려져 있네요 이님이 이야기 중 아래에 버튼이 있거든요 그래서 저거 누르면은 어 URL 생성을 할 수 있어요 그래서 한 가지 예시로 이미 하나가 생성이 돼 있죠 저 훅스 s.com 어쩌고 저쩌고 돼 있는 url이 이제 저 URL 호출하면 메시지가 전송이 되는 겁니다 그래서 요거는 아무 서비스나 제가 그냥 예시로 스크린샷을 하나 들고 와 봤는데 어 웬만한 외부 서비스들은 슬랙이 워낙 큰 메신저라는 다 제공을 해요 그래서 포 슬이라고 여기에는 돼 있는데 뭐 다른 서비스에는 다른 형태로 되어 있었겠죠 그 저기다가 우리가 맞는 웹을 딱 넣으면은 어떤 특정 동작을 했을 때 이제 알림이 가게 되는 거죠 아니면은 뭐 우리가 직접 서버를 만들겠다 하면은 그냥 레스트 API 호출하지 저 훅 API 호출하면 됩니다 그 슬 웹 훅의 장점은 메시지 보내는 용도로만 제한을 했을 때 개발을 거의 하나도 없이 쉽게 구현할 수 있다 쉽게 활용할 수 있다 이게 외국의 장점이죠 하지만 이제 단점은 그 외에 모든 동작을 수행할 수 없죠 슬레이 메시지 보내는 거 외에는 아무것도 할 수가 없습니다 근데 대부분의 슬랙봇 알림이라고 엄청 많기 때문에 그래서 이런 기능을 만든 거 같아요 알림만 구현하려면 맥북으로 쉽게 접근해 봐 근데 디테일한 동작을 구현하려면 서버 개발이 필요하거든요 그래서 우리는 볼트나 SDK이 두 가지 방법 중에 하나를 택해야 됩니다 그래서 먼저 볼트에 대해서 설명을 드리면 볼트는 프레임워크에 뭐 이거는 볼트 그 홈페이지 들어가서 제가 그냥 복사 붙여 놓기 해놓 어떤 정의인데 그냥 한글로 제가 설명을 드리면 슬렉 소통에 최적화된 서버 프레임워크다 라이크 스프링이라 제가 적어놨는데 사실 스프링이랑 여러 가지로 안 비슷하지만 그냥 서버 프레임워크라고 설명을 드려봤습니다 지원하는 언어는 세 개가 있어요 그래서 자바스크립트 타이스트 됩니다 당연히 그리고 파이썬 자바 세 가지가 있고 저는 자바스크립트 기준으로 예시 코드를 보여 드릴게요 이제 앱을 생성을 합니다 그래서 뉴앱 하고 어떤 객체를 하나 만들죠 그럼 토큰에 프로세스 엠저 환경 변수에 있는 보 토큰을 이제 입력을 해요 아까 우리 최초에 슬랙봇 만들 때 유저 토큰이란 봇 토큰 하나씩 나왔잖아요 그중에 봇 토큰을 여기다 입력을 하면 됩니다 그럼 저 앱 객체 토큰이 연결되니까 우리 앱이랑이 서버랑 연결이 되 거예요 그리고 서버를 시작하는 방법은 앱 다 스타트를 하면 됩니다 이거는 프레임워크 때문에 저 앱이라는 객체 안에서요 서버 관련된 기능들이 다 이미 구현이 되어 있는 거거든요 그래서 토큰 연결하고 스타트하면 이제 셀렉하고 소통을 시작할 수가 있게 되는 거예요 그럼 저 앱 객차가 우리 슬랙 앱이랑 연결이 돼 있으니까 일단 메시지를 받고 싶죠 슬랙에서 어떤 채팅을 쳤을 때이 서버가 채팅을 받아서 어떤 동작을 하고 싶은데 이벤트 리스너를 등록을 하면 돼요 앱 메시지 같은 거는 저 헬라는 메시지가 오는 거를 이제 리스닝 해라 그런 동작인데 요런 식으로 이벤트 리스너 동작하면 이제 슬랙으로 채팅을 받을 수 있게 되고 채팅 뿐만이 아니라 누군가 채널에 들어왔다 나갔다 아카이브 했다 뭐 여러 가지 슬렉 내의 사용자 동작들이 있잖아요 그래서 모두 다 리스닝을 할 수 있습니다 그리고 메시지 전송도 런 식으로 세이라는 어떤 메소드가 있죠 요것도 프레임워크 내에 다 구현된 함수고정 큰 한번 연결한 다음에 직관적인 어떤 이런 메소드들을 이용해서 셀렉하고 왔다 갔다 할 수 있게 되는 거죠 근데 전에 저 메시지라는 함수는 내가 어떻게 알 수 있지 세라는 함수가 있다는 걸 어떻게 알지 그래서 저거를 제가 알아서 써야 되는 거잖아요 레퍼런스를 이제 우리는 계속 봐야 되는데 슬렉 다대 그리고 볼트 JS 저거는 이제 언어에 따라 볼트 파이썬 뭐 볼트 잡아 치면 다 있거든요 그래서 볼트 홈페이지에 들어가면은 다 어떻게 메시지를 받는가 샌딩 메시지 하는가 뭐 그외 여러 가지 그 볼트 관련된 동작들에 대해서 레퍼런스가 있으니까 그래서 보시고 사용하시면 되겠습니다 그래서 SDK 넘어가 볼게요 SDK 아는 그 언어 자체이 단어 자체의 정의는 어떤 기능을 하기 위해서 미리 빌트 해 놓은 미리 빌드해 놓은 어떤 패키지 모음이라고 보면 되는데 슬렉 SDK 슬렉 소통 기능을 미리 갖춘 패키지 또는 라이브러리 를 의미합니다 프레임워크다 좀 더 작은 단위 그래서 지원 언어는 똑같아요 노드 JS 그니까 노드 슬 SDK 자바스크립트란 얘기죠 그리고 파이썬 자바 세 가지가 있고 어 요번에도 저는 노드 기준으로 좀 설명을 드릴게요 자바스크립트 기준으로 이제 SDK 프레임워크가 아니기 때문에 기능에 따라서 좀 여러 가지 패키지가 나눠져 있어요 이벤트 웹 뭐 인터랙티브 메시지 어쩌고 저쩌고 많이 있는데 우리는 무엇만 알면 되냐 사실 나머지 다 알면 좋은데 일단 제일 중요한게 뭐냐 제일 많이 쓰는게 뭐냐면 웹 API 있습니다 그래서 요것도 레퍼런스에 들어가야 돼요요 웹 API 어떤 메소드들이 있는지 여기 설명에 오버 130 메소드가 돼 있는데 뭐가 있는지 우리가 알아야 쓸 거잖아요 그래서 api.com 들어가면 독스가 있거든요 그 독스를 이제 한창 동안 뒤져보고 많이 사용을 하게 됩니다 그래서 독스의 레퍼런스 메뉴에서 뭐 이벤트도 알 수 있고 메소드도 알 수 있고 스코프 그외 여러가지 내가 원 라는 것에 대해서 SDK 활용하려면 이제 레퍼런스 많이 보시면서 하나하나 사용을 하시면 되겠죠 근데 SDK 서버를 구성하는 거는 SDK n 그냥 기능 모은 집이에요요 메소드 쓰면은 메시지 보낼 수 있어요 메소드 쓰면은 메시지 받을 수 있어 뭐이 정도 기능인 건데 이게 서버로 띄어져 있어야 우리는 슬하 소통을 할 거잖아요 그래서요 서버 구성은 기존 프레임워크로 알아서 구성을 하시면 됩니다 기존 뭐 프레임워크는 뭐든간에 서버를 그냥 우리가 따로 구성하고 SDK 따로 의존성으로 가져와서 활용을 하시면 돼요 그래서 서버 선택의 자유도가 되게 높아졌죠 스프링 장고 플라스크 노드 그 외에도 여러 가지 모두 모두 선택이 가능합니다 알아서 서버를 구성하고 우 SDK 셀렉하고 소통하는 기능으로서 활용을 하면 되겠습니다 저는 네스트 JS 걸로 좀 예시를 봤어요 그래서 예시를 또 네스트 기반해서 보여드리면 아까 볼트에서라는 객체 였는데 여기 SDK 있는 웹 API 웹 API SDK 있는 웹 클라이언트라면 객체를 만들면 됩니다 여기에서도 똑같이 보 토큰을 연결하면 돼요 저 파라미터에가 슬렉 보 토큰을 넣어 줬는데 저런 식으로 저 슬랙 클라이언트 개체 앱을 연결하는 방식입니다 그리고 요거는 어 슬 SDK 내용이 아니에요 그냥 네스트에서 서버를 시작하는 거죠 그럼 이제부터 저 네스트를 통해서 셀렉하고 왔다 갔다 할 수 있고 왔다 갔다 했을 때 슬랙 클라이언트 객체를 이용해서 슬하 소통을 할 수 있게 되는 거죠 슬랙에 이벤트를 받는 방법은 말씀드렸듯이 네스트의 기능인 거예요 그래 네스트에서 컨트롤러 설정을 하시고 스프링이랑 좀 비슷하죠 저 겟 어노테이션에 루트에서 패스 설정하시면 되고 슬랙에서 저 URL 호출하시면 됩니다 어 슬랙에서 어떻게 저 유을 호출하는 좀 뒤에다가 설명을 드릴게요 요거는 SDK 기능이 아닙니다 슬이 를 보내는 방법은 유사해요 저 슬 클라이언트 챗 포스트 메시지라는 어떤 함수가 있고 적절하게 파라미터들을 넣어 주면은 이제 메시지가 전송이 됩니다요 메소드의 파라미터가 어떻게 생겼지 방금 말씀드렸듯이 레퍼런스 홈페이지 가서 직접 보시고 하시면 돼요 그 볼트랑 SDK 뭐 한번 비교를 해 보자 그럼 볼트는 슬릭하고 소통하는 메소드 뿐만이 아니라 서버 프레임워크가 다 있으니까 그게 좀 편하다 케는 내가 서버 프레임워크를 선택할 수 있다 그래서 이제 자유도와 구연의 편의성 두 가지 차이가 있는데 제가 선택한 거는 SDK 선택을 했습니다 어 좀 더 서버 환경을 우리 맘대로 커스터마이징을 많이 하고 싶었어서 이렇게 선택을 했고요네 여기까지가 서버를 만드는 방식이었습니다 그래서 이제 서버를 만들고 슬래커 왔다 갔다 할 수 있는데 우리가 그냥 자체적으로 메시지 생성해서 슬레이만 주는게 아니라 어떤 외부 도구 고도 연동을 해야 진짜 재밌는 다양한 유용한 슬랙 앱들이 나올 거잖아요 그래서 외부 서비스 연동은 어떻게 하는지를 잠깐 말씀드리면 아까 슬릭 이벤트를 받는다고 했었죠 이렇게 컨트롤러로 요거를 외비 서비스에서 유아를 호출을 받으면 돼요 그래서 외부 서비스에서이 네스트 URL 호출 네스트 API 호출하고 내용에 현재는 리턴 디스 셀렉 서비스 겟 헬로 밖이 없는데 이제 저기다가 다른 어떤 슬랫과 소통을 하는 많은 동작을 직접 슬랙 클라이언트 이용해서 구현을 하시면 되겠죠 그래서 요것도 SDK 내용이 아니라 그냥 서버 구현하고 외부 서비스랑 레스트 API 주고 받으세요라는 내용입니다 굉장히 쉽죠 그래서 다시 슬랙봇 구성도를 다시 돌아보면 앱을 만들고 그 앱을 서버랑 연결하는 거는 보 토큰을 이용해서 객체에 이제 넣으면은 연결이 되고 그 보 토큰이 들어간 객체를 이용해서 셀렉하고 소통을 할 수 있고 외부 서비스랑 왔다 갔다 하는 거는 그냥 기존에 우리 개발하이 뭐디 커넥션을 맺든 레스트 API 하든 여기에는 뭐 다양하게 설명을 안 드렸지만 grpc 하든 그건 아무런 상관이 없습니다 알아서 외부 서비스랑 소통해서 그 컨트롤러 내에서 이제 그다음에 서비스 영역으로 넘어가서 셀렉에 기능들을 뿌려 주면 되겠죠 그런 식으로 슬랙을 구성하시면 되겠습니다네 일단 아주 기본적인 내용들만 말씀을 드렸는데 살짝만 더 딥하게 들어가서 설정을 좀만 더 볼게요 아까 슬 이벤트 보내기에서 전속 얘기를 드렸는데 사실 어 앱을 만들고 제가 한 대로만 쭉 따라가자아요 그 이제 동작을 안 할 겁니다 왜냐면 토크는 권한을 아직 제가 부여를 안 했거든요 아 일단 문서를 들어가야 됩니다 문서에 챗 포스트 메시지 내가 쓰고 싶은 메소드에 reire 스라고 있어요 그래서 저기에 토큰에이 메소드를 쓰려면 토큰에 이런 권한들이 있어야 돼라는 것들이 명시가 항상 되어 있거든요 그래서 저걸 확인하시고 오른쪽에 스쿠스 콘솔에서 들어가셔서 보 토큰에 권한을 추가를 하시면 이제 내가 원하는 메소드를 사용하실 수 있게 될 겁니다 그리고 슬렉 이벤트를 받는 것 아까 보여 드린 거죠 근데 슬랙에서 URL 호출을 어떻게 하지 요거를 예를 들어 내가 어떤 채팅을 쳤어 뭐 내가 채널을 나갔어 그래서 그런 이벤트가 일어났을 때 우리 서버를 셀렉해 호출하게 만들어 줘야 되는데 그걸 어떻게 할까 그러면 콘솔에 또다시 기능이 있습니다 이벤트 스크립션이요 단어들이 다 맨 처음에 우리 슬랙 앱 만들 때 펑셔널 어쩌고 저쩌고 설정할 때 있던 단어들이 그래서 이런 식으로 다 연결이 돼 있어요 그래서 이벤트 스크립션을 들어가서 온 스위치 하고 이제 내가 어떤 이벤트 받을 거야 앱 맨션은 내 앱이 맨션을 했을 때 그 외에 뭐 메시지 채널을 메시지 올라왔을 때 채널이 삭제됐을 때 런 기능들을 내가 제가 예시로 올려 놨는데 콘솔에서 구독할 이벤트를 추가하시면 이제 그 이벤트가 발생했을 때 내가 원하는 URL 이제 호출이 되게 할 수가 있습니다 이제 그 URL 요런 식으로 그냥 비어 있어요 리퀘스트 URL 그래서 저기다 입력을 하면 돼요 배포를 하면 도메인이 나올 거고 그 도메인을 저기다 올려 놓으면 되겠죠 근데 이제 기업 엔터프라이즈 환경에서 항상 있는 문제가 있죠 서버와 내부만이 있습니다 그래서 슬랙이 우리 서버로 호출할 수 없다면 어떡하죠 엄청 자주 있는 상황이겠죠 뭐 방합 역이든 어떤 vpc 나뉘어져 있든 다양한 이유로 그럴 때 이제 슬 보에서는 요런 기능을 제 해 소켓 모드라고 앱과 서버를 직접 연결하는 거죠 그럼요 소켓 모드는 어떻게 하나요 다시 콘솔에 들어갑니다 스캔 모드 스위치는 온하고 소캔 모드는 토큰을 하나 더 만들어야 돼요 봇 토큰은 내가 만드는 봇 유저에 대한 토큰인 건데이 소켓 모드는이 앱하나 서버를 직접 연결하는 개념인가 봐요 제가 자세하게 포진 않았지만 어쨌든 그런 식으로 보 토이랑 앱 레벨 토큰은 나뉘어져 있습니다 그래서 레벨 토큰을 하나더 생 을해야 돼요 그리고 클라이언트 이름이 좀 달라요 그래서 뉴 소켓 모드 클라이언트라고 기존에는 웹 클라이언트를 썼는데 좀 다른 클라이언트 쓰는 거죠 그리고 이제 토큰에는 아까는 슬보 토큰이 슬 앱 토큰을 연결 합니다 그래서 소켓 모드로 이벤트를 받고 싶으면 다른 클라이언트와 다른 토큰을 사용해야 돼요 그래서 요걸로 이벤트 어떻게 맞냐 하면 굉장히 쉬어요 슬 소켓 클라이언트에 온이라는 메서드가 있어요 그래 그리고 스트링으로 내가 받고자 하는 이벤트를 그냥 딱 적으면 저 이벤트가 발생했을 때요 리스너로 쭉 들어오게 되거든요 그래서 그다음에는 제가 원하는 어떤 동작을 구현을 하시면 되겠죠 그래서 이벤트 리스너 등록하면 된다 기존에 URL 받는 방식 하고는 뭐 아주 살짝 다르죠 근데요 멘션이라도 지금 제가 적어 놨는데 그럼 내가 무슨 이벤트 받을지 내가 어떻게 알아 그 저 스트링으로 하드 코딩으로 해야 되는 거잖아요 저 이름을 내가 어떻게 알 수 있어 그럼 다시 레퍼런스로 가면 됩니다 그래서 트랙볼을 만들 때는 레퍼런스 굉장히 많이 가야 돼요 내가 받고 싶은 이벤트가 뭐지 레퍼런스를 갑니다 내가 쓰고 싶은 메소드가 뭐지 레퍼런스 갑니다 권한이 뭐지 레퍼런스 갑니다 그래서 굉장히 홈페이지를 좀 끼고 살아야 개발을 잘할 수 있다네 여기까지가 이제 발표가 거의 마무리 돼 가고 있습니다 슬랙 봇으로 무엇을 할 수 있을까 제 예시를 좀 생각을 해 봤어요 우리 케이스에서 뭐 할까 일단은 우리 회사뿐만이 아니라 일반적으로 쓸 수 있는 예시 하나로는 어 스케줄러 하나가 동작을 해서 매일 아침 9시라고 예시를 되죠 아침 시마다 인사 디비에 휴가 인원 오늘 휴가 인원 알려 줘 그리고 그 스케줄러가 우리 슬랙봇 서버를 호출해서 매일 아침 시마다 휴가 인원을 알림을 쫙 줄 수 있습니다 아 그럼 오늘은 이런 이런 인원이 휴가를가 있구나라는 거를 뭐 물어보거나 제가 검색해 보지 않아도 매일 아침 9시에 어떤 특정한 채널에 알림을 받을 수 있겠죠 요런 식으로 만들 수도 있고 좀에 미 예시를 한번 들어볼게요 복지 티켓을 쓰고 싶은 어떤 한 명이 있었어요 그래서 5월 7일에 nrt 나리타 예약률을 알려 달라고 슬랙봇 서버에 문의를 했습니다 그냥 채팅으로 하는 거예요 채지 PT 이렇게 알려 줘 뭐 하든 아니 어떤 명력을 하는 특정한 어떤 명령을 치면은 이제 셀렉 서버가 예약 DV 뭐 pss DV pdc 어디든 들어가겠죠 뭐 nit 예약률을 알려줘서 받았습니다 그럼 5월 7일에 nit 50 자석이 남아 있다 현 시점으로 그런 슬랙에 이제 뿌려줍니다 5월 7일 nit 50자 남았습니다 그럼 물어본 사람은 슬랙을 통해서 답변을 받는 거죠 이걸 통해서 내가 그날 foc PT 90을 쓸까 말까를 판단해 볼 수 있겠습니다 그래서 원래 사실 이거 못 하는 거 아니거든요 우리 다 할 수 있어요 TV 직접 조회하면 되죠 태블로 들어가서 하면 되죠 다 하실 수 있으신데 요거를 뭐 개발을 잘 모르시는 분들 뭐 승무원 분들이든 정비사 분들이든 아니면 우리만 하더라도 사실 저도 태블로 들어가 가 하는 거 잘 모르거든요 그니까 모두가 할 수 있는 방법은 아니란 말이에요 할 수는 있겠지만 근데 슬랙 봇으로 이렇게 중간 다리를 잘 지정을 해 놓으면은 DV 직접 조회하지 않고도 사람들이 누구나 원하는 기능을 동작을 할 수 있다라는 예시를 들어봤습니다네 봇 활용 예시 3로 넘어가 보면은 어 이제 스케줄러에서 항공 스케줄에가 내일 스케줄을 달라고 문의를 합니다 그럼 다시 스케줄러가 우리 슬보 서버를 호출해서 만약에 월 7일에 샌프란시스코 비행이 있다면 채널 생성을 해 줘 그리고 그 비행이 포함되어 있는 조종사 ABC고 def 승무원도 초대를 해 줘를 자동으로 뿌릴 수 있겠죠 저 일정을 받았다면 그럼 이제 그 채널에서 비행을 하는 동안 이륙과 이제 착륙 동안 많은 대화들이 오갈 수 있겠습니다 그래서 비행 관련 커뮤니케이션이 일어나고 비행 한 1 2 뒤쯤 저 숫자들은 언제 된지 바뀔 수 있는 거예요 그래서 비행 1 2일 뒤쯤에 5월 7일 sfo 비행 채널을 이제 카이브 하고요 비행이 어땠는지 평가 링크도 관련 사람들에게 메일이 didn't 채널로 미리 보내든 할 수 있을 거예요 그래서 요런 식으로 비행의 커뮤니케이션 관리를 자동화할 수 있을 것 같아요 그래서 비행에 누가 들어가 있고 그래서 그 사람들이 대화할 수 있는 창을 만들고 그 사람들이 대화가 완료되면 아카이브 하고 아카이브 했으니까 언제든지 다시 들어가서 볼 수 있겠죠 그런 식 히스토리도 남기고 그래서 요거를 누군가 챙겨야 할 거란 말이에요 만약 렇게 보시 안 해 주면은 사람이 어 내일 비행 누가 있더라 인지해야 되고 그 사람도 초대해야 되고 채널 이제 잘 대화한 다음에 히스토리도 챙겨야 될 거고 할게 너무 많을 텐데 그런 자재들을 그냥 셀렉 서버로 자동화 하면은 이제 우리의 비행 시나리오도 커뮤니케이션을 자동화할 수 있겠다 예시를 하나 또 생각을 해 봤습니다 그래서 보세의 영향력은 슬랙 보스의 영향력은 슬랙은 아랑 운항 뭐 그외에도 그냥 우리 모두가 활용하는 에어프레미아 주요 커뮤니케이션 있잖아요 그래서 슬랙 봇은 전사 생산성을 향상시킨다고 생각합니다 왜냐면 우리 모두가 사용하는 툴에서 어떤 동작을 함께 할 수 있는 거니까요 그래서 웃슨 봇을 만들까라고 생각을 하면은 저는 어려운 거 같더라고 우리 뭐 만들지 제 발표를 듣고 혹시나 잘 들으셨다면 너무 슬랙 꽃이 좋겠다 나도 만들고 싶어 근데 뭐만 되지 하면 생각이 잘 안 나실 수 있는데 우리 업무 중에서 자동화 할 수 있는 일이 무엇이 있을까 그고 좀 더 풀어서 생각을 하면은 뭔가 생각이 잘 나시지 않을까라고 생각을 하고요 근데 우리 업무 자동화라인게 업무 자체가 혼자서 하는 일이 하나도 없잖아요 회사의 일은 모두 다 함께 하는 일인데 함께 만들어야 한다 어떤 업무를 어떻게 자동화 하지라는 기획하는 단계에서부터 의견 많이 듣고 이제 그거에 따라 개발해 나가고 하는 걸 함께 만들어야 될 거 같거든요 그래서 여러분 많은 여러분들의 기어가 필요하고 부탁드립니다 그래서 저는 그냥 환경만 만들었을 뿐이고 좀 많이 기여해 해주시면 좋겠어요 방금 말씀드린 어떤 예시들을 직접 만들어 주시면 큰 도움이 될 거 같습니다 그래서 언제부터 그럼이 보을 만들 수 있냐 하면 바로 지금부터 할 수 있습니다 들어가서 이제 개발을 시작하시면 되겠고요 배포도 오늘 찬우 님께서 도와주셔서 잘해 놨거든요 일단 저거 하면은 그냥 지금 헬로월드 그런 거 밖에 안 뜰 텐데 이제 내용을 조금씩 조금씩 더 추가를 해 놔야 그래서 많은 분들이이 내포에서 기어를 해 주시기를 기대를 하겠습니다 그래서 기술로 정사 생산성을 늘리는 경험이라는게 쉽지 않거든요 쉽지 않다는게 일단 난이도도 있고요 웬만큼 큰 회사에서는 이미 툴들이 많이 있고요 그래서 내가기할 기회가 많이 없겠죠 그리고 이런 권한도 잘 주지 않습니다 뭐 누가 비행기 어떤 TV 접근해서 이런 거 만들래요 하는데 우리 같은 상황이 아니라면 어느 회사든 이렇게 쉽게 얻을 수 있는 경험이 아니거든요 근데 우리는 할 수 있다 에어프레미아는 아직 너무나 초창기 때문에 어 다 같이 할 수 있다 라고 생각을 하고 그래서 요런 커리어와 성과를 모두 가져가는 경험을 슬을 통해서 얻어가시면 좋겠습니다 일단 오늘 40분 정도했는데 제 발표는 여기까지였습니다 감사합니다\n",
            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: gpt를 사용하기 위해서 API 키를 발급받는 방법을 알려드리도록 하겠습니다 우선 오픈 ai를 검색하고 사이트에 접속합니다 [음악] 싱크트리에서 api로 호출 할 것이기에 상단에 api를 클릭합니다 오픈 aid가 없다면 회원가입을 진행하도록 하고요 저는 이미 가입한 아이디가 있기 때문에 바로 로그인 하도록 하겠습니다 참고로 오픈 ai에서는 첫 회원가입자의 안에 18달러 상당의 크레딧을 제공합니다 우선 로그인을 하면 웰컴 투 오픈 ai라는 창이 보입니다 여기서 우리는 오픈 ai가 제공하는 여러가지 api를 사용해 보는 겁니다 좌측 상단에 이그잼플스로 들어가서 호출해 볼 api를 선택해 봅시다 우리는 GPT 챗봇을 만들거기 때문에 하단을 쭉 내려보면 아래의 체리라는 api를 클릭합니다 여기 api를 호출하기 위한 API 리퀘스트를 보면네 번째 줄에 오픈 AI API 키가 있는데 우리는 여기에 필요한 API 키를 발급받을 겁니다 화면 밖으로 나가셔서 오른쪽 상단의 계정을 클릭해보면 뷰스 API 키가 있을 거예요 클릭합니다 저는 기존의 발급받은 키가 있는데요 한 개 더 발급 받아보겠습니다 여기 크리에이트 뉴 시크릿 키 버튼을 누르시면 친절하게도 자동으로 키를 발급해줍니다 이 창을 나가게 되면이 API 키를 다시는 볼 수 없으니 현재 창에서 키 값을 복사한 뒤 개인 노트에 따로 저장해둡니다 다음에는 gpt를 싱크트리에서 호출하기에 앞서 간단하게 호출 테스트를 해보고 넘어가겠습니다 호출 테스트를 위해 저는 포스트맨이라는 툴을 사용하겠습니다 gpt는 단순 데이터를 받아오는 것 보다는 우리가 작성한 프롬프트를 기반으로 리액션 즉 답변을 줄 것이기 때문에 호출 메서드는 포스트로 설정을 바꿔줍니다 메서드창 옆 벤터 리퀘스트 url에 우리가 호출할 url을 복사 붙여넣기 해줍니다 여기 다시 h라고 나와 있는 부분은 헤더의 데이터를 의미합니다 이 부분은 url을 입력한 바로 아래 헤더를 클릭 하면 키 밸류 형태로 데이터를 입력할 수 있는데이 부분에 리퀘스트 헤더 값들을 입력해줍니다 [음악] 그 아래 헤더에서 키에는 어소라이제이션 부분에 밸류는 배열을 띠고 아까 발급받은 키를 넣어줍니다 [음악] [음악] [음악] 다실이는 데이터를 의미하고이 부분은 리퀘스트 바디에 넣어주도록 합시다 여기 복사 붙여넣기로 넣어주고 프롬프트 값을 수정해서 내가 원하는 gpt에게 하고 싶은 말을 적으시면 됩니다 어 저는 간단한 질문 하나를 해볼게요 이렇게 where is south korea라고 질문하면 리스폰스 값에 초이스 하단 텍스트의 답변이 온 걸 확인할 수 있습니다 이제 우리는 여기 리스폰스 데이터에서 내가 필요한 초이스의 텍스트만 뽑아서 답을 받고 싶을 거예요이 과정을 싱크 트리를 통해 간단하게 데이터를 받고 정제하는 방법을 알아보도록 합시다 싱크트리 서비스를 이용하기에 검색창에 싱크트리라고 입력해 봅시다 가장 상단에 있는 링크를 클릭하시면 싱크트리의 사이트로 들어와집니다 왼쪽 상단에 시작하기 버튼을 클릭하시면 로그인 창이 나오고 싱크트리 서비스를 사용해 본 적이 있다면 그대로 로그인 아니면 하단에 회원가입을 진행해 주시면 됩니다 저는 이미 가입한 아이디가 있으니 바로 로그인 하겠습니다 싱크트리에서는 서비스를 만들 수 있는 인프라 환경을 기본으로 제공하기 때문에 바로 제작에 들어갈 수 있습니다 오른쪽 상단에 크리에이트 앱 버튼을 눌러서 GPT 앱을 만들어 줍니다 GPT 앱 안에서 비즈 유닛을 만들 수 있습니다 비즈 유닛은 싱크트리에서 제공하는 블럭들을 기반으로 쉽게 개발할 수 있는 환경입니다 애드 비즈 유닛에서 필수 값들을 입력하고 비지 유닛을 애드합니다 [음악] [음악] 이렇게 대부 환경에 아까 만든 리비전 이름으로 환경이 구성되고 대부환경에서 개발을 시작하시면 됩니다 비지 유닛에서는 다양한 블럭들을 사용해 보실 수 있습니다 우리의 목표는 싱크트리에서 오픈 ai의 gpt를 호출하고 그 리스폰스 값을 받아와 대량의 리스폰스의 데이터 중 답변에 대한 부분만 받아오고 싶습니다 그러기 위해서는 순차적으로 오픈 ai의 gpt를 먼저 호출해 봅시다 외부 API 호출을 위해 싱크트리에선 트랜스퍼블럭을 사용하면 됩니다 왼쪽 중간 보라색 오퍼레이터를 클릭하면 트랜스퍼 블럭이 보이고 블럭을 드래그 앤드롭해서 디즈니스 로직이 들어가는 스테이트먼츠에 넣어주시면 됩니다 아까 포스트맨에서 호출했던 것과 같이 진행해 봅시다 엔드포인트 URL 부분에 url을 주소 복사 붙여넣기 [음악] 리퀘스트 헤더에는 콘텐츠 타입 어플리케이션 제이슨 그리고 어소라이제이션 블럭을 추가해 보도록 하겠습니다 추가할 핵심에 벨루스 옆 톱니바퀴를 클릭하면 블럭을 추가할 수 있습니다 왼쪽에 해쉬맵 페어 블록을 선택해서 하단에 추가해 줍니다 여기 키에는 어소라이제이션 키에는 밸류는 발급받아 저장해 두었던 API 키 값을 넣어줍시다 [음악] 바디에도 해쉬맵 밸류로 값들을 하나씩 넣어주면 되지만 우리는이 방법이 너무 귀찮아요 이런 분들을 위해 싱크트리에서는 제이슨 형태의 데이터를 입력하면 블럭으로 바로 생성해주는 강력한 기능이 있습니다 창단의 블록 모양을 클릭하시고 코드를 입력하고 메이크 블럭을 클릭 하면 여기 블럭이 접혀 있는 상태로 만들어집니다 익스펜드로 블럭을 보게 되면 데이터가 나타나게 됩니다 위 블럭을 리퀘스트 바디 값으로 넣고 호출하도록 하겠습니다 [음악] [음악] 우리가 하고 싶은 질문은 프롬프트의 밸류에 적으면 됩니다 [음악] [음악] 창단의 테스팅 기능을 통해 호출을 하면 이렇게 gpt에 api를 싱크트리를 통해 호출 가능하도록 만들었습니다 이번에는 gpt의 리스폰스가 너무 많은 데이터를 가지고 있기 때문에이 데이터를 정제해서 필요한 부분만 가져와 보도록 하겠습니다 우리가 가져올 부분은 리스폰스 바디의 초이스 그중에 텍스트 부분이 gpt에 답변이기 때문에이 부분만 데이터를 정제해 보겠습니다 우선 블럭들의 역할을 명확히 하도록 코스 섹션이라는 블럭을 통해 역할을 명시해 주도록 하겠습니다 트랜스퍼블럭을 통해 gpt를 호출하는 부분이라는 코멘트를 달아서 구분하도록 하겠습니다 [음악] [음악] 이후 호출한 데이터를 정제하는 부분을 만들어 보도록 하겠습니다 [음악] 변수의 받아온 데이터를 넣고 q&a라는 변수에 엔스의 데이터를 정제하도록 하겠습니다 [음악] [음악] [음악] 개태심의 밸류 블럭으로 리스폰스의 바디에의 초이스에서 초이스는 어레이 데이터이기 때문에 텍스트가 나와 있는 부분은 인티저 0번의 텍스트의 밸류 값만 가져와 보도록 하겠습니다 [음악] [음악] [음악] 이제 q&a의 데이터가 잘 정제되어 담겨 있는지 확인해 보도록 하겠습니다 이제 우리는 싱크트리를 통해 원하는 질문을 하고 gpt에 답변만 받아올 수 있게 만들었습니다 우리는 지금까지 블럭의 프롬프트의 밸류 값을 수정하며 질문을 바꿨지만 여러분은이 방법이 번거로우실 거예요 그래서 질문을 할 부분을 테스팅에서 할 수 있도록 바꿔봅시다 리퀘스트 바디의 입력을 받을 부분을 블럭을 통해 만들어 보겠습니다 [음악] 리퀘스트 데이터라는 변수를 만들고 비즈 리퀘스트의 데이터를 패치로 긁어 옵니다 이후에 마찬가지로 퀘스천이라는 변수를 만들어 데이터를 담고 정제해 보겠습니다 [음악] [음악] [음악] [음악] [음악] [음악] [음악] 통해 req의 밸류를 가져옵니다 그리고 우리가 입력한 부분이 GPT 호출의 프롬프트까지 들어가도록 설정해주면 이렇게 간단하게 gpt를 통한 api를 개발할 수 있게 됩니다 이제 테스트를 해보시면 테스팅 창에서 질문을 동적 변수로 넣어 gpt로 지리응답을 받을 수 있습니다 [음악] [음악] 이렇게 싱크 트리를 통해 20분 만에 API 발급부터 사용 간단히 해보았습니다 안녕하세요 이번 챕터에서 슬랙 잉커밍 웹북을 생성해 보도록 하겠습니다 [음악] 인커밍 에폭을 설정하기 위해서 슬랙 API 페이지에 접속해 보겠습니다 우측 상단의 6월 앱스를 클릭합니다 그리고 새로운 앱을 생성하겠습니다 워크스페이스는 사용하실

[음악] 포스트맨으로 방금 생성된 url을 지정하여 바디값으로 적당한 텍스트를 넣어보면 리스폰스 값으로 ok가 확인됩니다 외국 설정은 끝났습니다 이제 해당 api로 슬랙 메시지를 보낼 수 있습니다 이번 챕터에서는 싱크트리를 활용하여 만들어 두었던 채널의 / 커맨드 이벤트를 통해서 특정 메시지를 발생시키는 기능을 구현해 보도록 하겠습니다 슬랙 API 페이지에 접속해 보도록 하겠습니다 앱지에서 만들어둔 채 gpt를 선택 좌측 바에 퓨처 슬래시 커맨드로 들어가 새로운 커맨드를 만들어 줍니다 호출할 커맨드 이름을 콜 gpt로 하겠습니다 다음 리퀘스트 url에 호출될 api를 등록해야 합니다 호출될 url을 먼저 생성해 보도록 하겠습니다 싱크트리로 접속해 앱을 만들고 하이로 비지 유닛을 생성해 주도록 하겠습니다 [음악] [음악] 호출될 비즈니스의 정상적으로 로그가 남는지 보기 위해 로그 블럭을 하나 남겨놓고 이후 호출 테스트 때 해당 로그 확인해 보도록 하겠습니다 그리고 해당 api를 외부로 노출하기 위해 대부 단계의 비즈 유닛을 프로덕 단계로 올리도록 하겠습니다 그리고 API 포탈 페이지로 이동해 새로운 api를 만들고 API 리소스로 방금 프로덕 단계를 올려둔 빚을 유닛을 추가해 주겠습니다 [음악] 이러면 외부로 공개될 API url이 만들어졌습니다 이제 다시 슬랙 API 페이지로 돌아와 호출될 API url을 작성해줍니다 이제 / 커맨드 이벤트를 만들었습니다 생성한 이벤트가 적용되도록 워크스페이스에 링스토를 진행해줍니다 [음악] 이제 테스트를 진행해 보도록 하겠습니다 챗 gpt3의 슬래시 콜 gpt를 입력하면 해슘의 형태의 데이터가 확인됩니다 [음악] 이제 정상적으로 호출됐는지 로그 확인을 해보도록 하겠습니다 다음과 같이 콜 gpt라는 로그가 정상적으로 찍힌게 확인이 되었습니다 / 커맨드 기능을 정상적으로 구현했습니다 이제 리스폰스 값으로 슬랙 블록킷 기능을 활용해서 다른 결과값이 나타나도록 추가적으로 구현해 보도록 하겠습니다 슬랙 블록 킥 빌더 페이지에 접속해 보겠습니다 해당 페이지는 슬랙에서 사용하는 다양한 형태의 텍스트를 제이슨 형태로 변형해서 보여주는 페이지입니다 저는 미리 원하는 형태의 제이슨을 만들어 두었습니다 영상에서는 미리 만들어둔 블록 기준으로 구현이 진행됩니다 해당 제이슨 데이터를 복사하겠습니다 [음악] 슬랙 챗봇 비즈니스로 돌아가 임포트 버튼을 눌러 복사한 내용을 붙여넣기 하겠습니다 해당 제이슨 데이터를 블록으로 만들기를 누르면 제이슨 데이터가 블록 형태로 만들어집니다 잠시 해당 블록을 주석으로 막아두고 트랜스포 블록을 꺼내겠습니다 기존에 만들어 놓은 인커밍 웨프 url을 트랜스포머 블록에 url에 넣어주겠습니다 그리고 주석으로 막아둔 제이슨 데이터를 리퀘스트 바디 값으로 넣어주고 저장 빌드 후 테스트 진행해 보도록 하겠습니다 [음악] 테스트 결과 다음과 같이 / 커맨드로 호출했을 때 원하는 블록킷 형태로 메시지가 나오는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다 이번 챕터에서는 텍스트 박스의 내용에 대한 질의를 클릭 이벤트를 통해 gpt에 답변을 슬랙으로 받을 수 있는 기능을 싱크트리로 구현해 보도록 하겠습니다 [박수] 싱크트리로 접속해 보겠습니다 [음악] 새로운 비즈 유닛을 만들겠습니다 [음악] 이전 영상에서처럼 로그를 하나 찍어두고 외부의 공개되게 API 포털 쪽에 새로운 api를 생성하도록 하겠습니다 비즈니스 프로덕까지 올리고 좌측 바에 API 포탈로 접속하겠습니다 저는 이전에 만들어두었던 슬랙 지피티에 추가를 해서 등록하겠습니다 [음악] 이제 외부에 공개되는 url이 만들어졌습니다 [음악] 클릭 이벤트 등록을 진행해 보도록 하겠습니다 슬랙 API 페이지에 접속해 보겠습니다 채 GPT 앱으로 들어가 보겠습니다 좌측 바에 퓨처 인터랙티비티 & showcart 클릭 인터랙티비티를 활성화 시켜줍니다 [음악] 활성화 시키면 리퀘스트 url이 확인될 것입니다 [음악] 여기에 방금 전에 생성한 API url을 넣어줍니다 그리고 숄카츠를 생성해 줍니다 콜백 아이디로 블루킷에서 만든 클릭 블럭의 콜백 아이디를 입력해줍니다 새로운 이벤트를 등록했기 때문에 워크스페이스에 리 인스톨을 진행해줍니다 이제 해당 클릭 이벤트가 발생할 시에 방금 제작한 api가 호출될 것입니다 꽃을 테스트를 진행해 보겠습니다 슬랙에서 클릭 박스를 클릭 그리고 나서 호출이 정상적으로 되었는지 로그를 확인해 보면 다음과 같이 정상적으로 호출되었다는 걸 알 수 있습니다 호출이 된 것은 확인했고 실제로 어떤 데이터를 리퀘스트 값으로 보내는지 확인해 보겠습니다 [음악] 전체 요청 값을 패치 블록으로 확인해 보겠습니다 로그로 패치 값을 찍어보면 다음과 같은 형태의 제이슨 데이터가 들어오고 있다는 걸 알 수 있습니다 데이터를 확인해 보시면 슬랙 블록에서 보내주고 있는 블록킷에 대한 정보가 있습니다 [음악] 여기서 텍스트 블럭 값이 필요합니다 이 데이터를 추출해서 활용해 보도록 하겠습니다 데이터를 보시면 블록 아이디는 호출할 때마다 바뀌는 값으로 추출해서 사용해야 합니다 [음악] 그리고 그 아이디의 밸류 값을 추출하여 텍스트를 가져오겠습니다 해시 매평터의 데이터들을 [음악] 웹블럭을 사용하여 필요한 페이로드 값을 추출하겠습니다 [음악] 이후 제이슨 디코드 블록을 사용하여 d코드를 진행하고 필요한 데이터들을 계속해서 추출하여 변수 형태로 저장해 두겠습니다 [음악] 최종적으로 [음악] 텍스트 값이 확인되었고이 값을 GPT 호출하는 텍스트 값으로 주어 gpt를 호출하면 됩니다 [음악] 텍스트 값을 바디 값으로 gpt를 호출합니다 정상적으로 지리에 대한 답변이 확인되는지 테스트를 진행해 보도록 하겠습니다 [음악] 러그를 보시면 하이 gpt에 대한 정상적인 답변을 확인하실 수

            "Translation error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType, Original text: [음악] 네 안녕하세요 파이썬으로 월 몇백원 대에 산의 슬랙봇 운영해 본 이야기 세션 발표를 진행하게 된 지니라고 합니다 지금부터 발표를 시작하도록 [박수] 하겠습니다네 발표에 앞서 간단하게 제소개를 먼저 드리고자 합니다 저는 이제 그 주식회사 알로카 스라는 이제 크립토 게열 스타트업에서 백엔드 혹은 이제 데보스 엔지니어로 근무 중이고요 이제 저를 비롯해서 저희 회사는 이제 모든 백엔드 시스템을 파이썬 기반으로 만들어 왔을 정도로 파이썬에 굉장히 많은 애정을 갖고 있습니다 그래서 파이썬에 이렇게 첫 참가를 하게 되는 것도 굉장히 큰 영광으로 생각하고 있습니다 현재도 알카도 n 파이썬 백엔드 엔지니어를 지금도 모집 중이니 혹시 관심 있으시다면 연락 주시면 감사하겠습니다네 그러면 이번 세션의 진행 순서입니다 세션의 주요 포인트는 쉽게 만들고 관리할 수 있는 파이썬 기반 슬랙봇 a 개발입니다 그래서 저희 팀이 사내에서 이제 내부 솔루션을 만들기에 앞서서 왜 슬랙봇 선택을 했는지 그리고 어떤 식으로 기술 스택을 고려를 해 보았는지 슬랙 포을 통해 어떤 걸 만들어 볼 수 있는지에 대해 중점적으로 다뤄 보려고 합니다 이것에 더불어서 이제 좀 슬랙 포스의 기반으로서 이제 슬랙 그 체오스 솔루션을 만들어 가보며 팀 내 업무 환경을 좀 개선시켜 나가는 재미에 대해서도 좀 공유 드리면 좋겠다라고 생각을 하고 있습니다 이제 해당 세션을 추천드리고 싶은 청자분 좀 생각을 해 보았습니다 뭐 먼저 이제 소규모 팀들 특히나 이제 좀 이러한 것들의 공수를 드리고 싶지 않은 간단하게 체스 솔루션을 만들고 싶어 하시는 분들에게 정말 좋을 것 같고요 그리고 이제 이제 기 보통 이제 보편적으로 it 기업들이 다 슬랙을 쓰고 있는데 왜 이렇게 슬랙 다 쓰는지 모르겠다라고 하시는 분들도 좋을 것 같고요 그리고 이제 막 갓 파이썬을 딱 배웠는데 어 이제 파이썬으로 좀 유용한 거 뭔가 좀 생산적인 걸 만들어보고 싶다 는 분들도 굉장히 좋은 거 같습니다 그래서 좀 중급이 일단 세션을 넣어두긴 했지만 중급 중에서 좀 초급에 좀 가까운 거 같아요 그리고 이제 마지막으로 좀 심심하다 하시는 분들도 굉장히 좋은 거 같고요네 그래서 이제 일단 가장 먼저 왜 이런 솔루션이 필요하냐 이야기인 거 같아요 일단은 회사는 굉장히 바쁜 거 같아요 그리고 스타트업은 그중에서도 굉장히 또 바쁘고요 회사는 성장함에 따라서 굉장히 바빠지기 마련이고 그에 따라 몇몇 부분적으로 효율적으로 만 려는 시도가 생겨나기 마련입니다 하지만 어느 정도 기반이 마련된 조직이 아닌 이상 이런 내부 솔루션에서조차 리소스를 투자할 여유가 마땅하지 않은 팀도 굉장히 많습니다 그래서 지금이 그림에서 보시는 거 같은 이런 딜레마가 생겨나기 정말 나름이죠 그래서 저 또한 이런한 상황에 놓여 있었고 가장 간단하면서도 퀄리티는 높게 운영 효율화를 가져올 수 있는 솔루션을 고민을 하다가 이제 체스하는 이제 것들을 선택을 하게 되었습니다 그럼 이제 여기서이 체스하는 것이 뭐냐 도스란 이제 채팅 기반 클라이언트를 통해서 개발 혹은 여러 운영 작업을 용이하게 하는 것을 말하는 것인데요이 분야에서는 이미 이제 슬랙에서 다양한 서드파티 봇과 함께 여러 외부 서비스들을 쉽게 연동할 수 있는 생태계가 만들어져 있습니다 그래서 많은 분들이 이제 슬랙 보이라고 한다면 이제 웹훅 기능 등으로 간단하게 사용을 해본 경험이 있으실 수 있습니다 그 외에도 이제 사용 방법을 좀 더 나아가서 익히신다면 이제 커맨드 액션 쇼트컷 이벤트 훅 워크플로 스텝 등 다양한 기능 를 제공을 하고 있기 때문에 여러분들이 업무 환경에서 이미 슬랙 메신저를 사용을 하고 계신다면 업무 효율을 충분히 증진시키 수 있을 것이라 기대합니다 그래서 슬랙 봇을 개발을 하기 위해서는 먼저 그 봇 서버라고 해서 뭐 쉽게 말씀드리면 http 통신이 가능한 API 서버에 구축이 필요합니다 여기서도 이제 다양한 선택지가 있을 수가 있는데 저는 다음과 같은 고려 사항들을 중점에 두고 기술 스택을 선정을 해 보았습니다 가장 먼저 개발이 쉽고 빨라야 합니다이 제 제가 만들어야 하는이 봇은 이제 메인 프로덕트가 아니었기 때문에 이제 약간 우선순위가 낮았어요 그렇기 때문에 최대한 스트레스를 맞지 않고 개발을 해야 했습니다 그리고 두 번째는 이제 배포가 쉽고 후에 손이 가야 하지 않아야 했습니다 이걸 배포한 후에도 전기적으로 막 서버가 터졌다는 기능이 작동이 안 다느니 이런 것으로 제보를 받고 스트레스를 받고 싶지 않았거든요 그래서 이런 거에 관련해서 모니터링을 하고 이런 걸 또 유지보수하는 거에 최소화하는 뭔가 그러한 인프라를 사용했으면 좋겠다라고 생각을 했습니다 그리고 세 번째가 이제 최소한의 호스팅 비용입니다이 주제에서 제가 어그로를 끈 것과 약간 연관이 있는 건데 이제 예를 들어서 산회 솔루션을 저희가 만든다고 가정을 했을 때 만약에 일반적인 aws 뭐 ec2 인스턴스 같은 거에 저희가이 이걸 호스팅을 한다고 하면 24시간 동안 비용이 나가는데 사실 산네 솔루션은 24시간 풀타임으로 사용을 하지가 않죠 그렇기 때문에 비용이 상당히 비효율적이라고 할 수도 있습니다 그래서 가능하면 이런 것들도 굉장히 좀 효율적으로 사용을 할 수 있으면 비용을 청구할 수 있으면 굉장히 좋겠다라는 생각을 하게 되었습니다 그리고 마지막으로 만들면서 재밌으면 좋겠죠네 파이썬이 딱 그게 좋은 언어인 거 같고요 결론적으로 저는 이제 다음과 같은 기술 스택으로 결정을 해 보았습니다 단 웹서버 같은 경우에는 이제 마이크로웹 프레임워크로 유명한 플라스크로 개발을 진행을 했고요 슬 SDK 통해 슬랙에 관련된 여러 기능들의 구현을 진행을 해보았습니다 랙 같은 경우에는 이제 모든 메소드를 사실 레스트 API 진행을 하고 있기 때문에 반드시 stk 사용할 필요는 없지만 개발 편의성을 위해서 채택을 했습니다 사실 실제로 슬랙 같은 경우는 공식적으로 이제 볼트라는 프레임워크도 사용을 그 그 지원을 하고 있기 때문에 검토하실 때 이런 부분도 함께 고려를 해 보시면 좋을 것 같습니다 또한 이제 배포를 위해서는 저희는 좀 더 쉽게 클라우드의 어플리케이션을 배포하기 위해 이제 파라고 하는 프레임워크를 사용을 했는데요이 부분은 바로 다음 페이지에서 자세히 다루도록 하겠습니다 그외에는 이제 팀에서 사용 중인 여러 외부 API 입맛대로 직접 이제 통합시키기 하면 되는 부분입니다이 부분은 이제 이후에 슬라이드에서 함께 다뤄보면 좋을 것 같습니다 이제이 자파는 파이썬의 웹 어플리케이션을 쉽게 클라우드의 서버리스 서비스로 배포시 주는 프레임워크입니다 쉐에 이제 단 몇 줄만 쳐도 장고 플라스크 같은 웹을 이제 aws 람다 API 게이트웨이를 배포하고 각종 세팅도 자동으로 완료시 주게 됩니다 실제로 지금 보고 계신 영상이 간단한 플라스크 앱을 코딩부터 람다의 배포하기 하는 그 전 커맨드 라인 영상을 그냥 풀로 하고 있는 영상입니다 그래서 산의 솔루션인만큼 이러한 봇 서버를 배포하고 관리하는 것에 있어 뭔가 확장성 있는 거대한 아키텍처 보다는 저희가 좀 비용의 큰 절감과 유지보수의 편리성의 중점을 두었고 서버리스 기반으로 서비스를 구축을 하였습니다 이게 사실 제목에 써져 있는 월 몇백 원이라는 거의 가장 그냥 가장 큰 비결이기 하죠 그래서 자파 자체 같은 경우에는 사실 작년에 파이콘 세션에서도 자세하게 다루고 있는 영상이 있기 때문에 그쪽을 참고해 주시면 좋을 것 같습니다네 그럼 이제 본격적으로 슬랙 보의 어떤 여러 기능들에 대해서 간단하게 설명을 드려 보고자 하는데요 사실 모든 것을 설명드리기 불가능하기 때문에 어떤 부분을 좀 보여 드리면 고민을 하다가 난이도를 상중하로 해서 한 세 가지 정도만 예를 들어 보려고 했습니다 첫 번째가 이제 주사의 기능이에요 뭐 예를 들어서 다음과 같이 이렇게 채널에 이단 그 봇을 맨션을 하면서 다이라고 커맨드를 치면 뭐 랜덤으로 숫자를 골라서 쓰레드로 답장을 해 주는 기능을 만들어 본다라고 저희가 이제 가정을 하는 거죠 근데이 그래서 이거는 이제 슬랙에 이제 이벤트 API 아는 기능을 이제 사용을 하는 것입니다 그래서 보에 이제 맨션 되는 이벤트를 감지를 해서 보 서버에 리퀘스트를 보내고 이것이 기능으로 작동을 하는 원리인데요 이거를 이제 도식화한 것은 이제 다음 페이지와 같습니다 그래서 슬랙 내부에서는 이제 다양한 이벤트들이 돌고 돕니다 그래서 여러 가지 이벤트들이 있는데이 봇은 그 특정한 이벤트들 중 자신이 원하는 이벤트를 구독을 하여 그 이벤트가 발생을 했을 때 그 정보를 수신 받을 수가 있습니다 그래서 그 후 자신이 가르키고 있는 보 서로 http 리퀘스트를 보냄으로써 이제 자신이 구축해 놓은 보 서버가이 이벤트에 반응을 하여 원하는 액션을 취할 수 있도록 할 수 있도록 합니다 만약에 해당 다이스 커맨드의 경우에는 이제이 그림에 적혀 있는 앱 멘션이라도 오게 되는데 이제 보스 서버는 이에 반응을 하여 이제 포스트 메시지라는 메소드를 실행을 해서 실제 슬렉 채널에 메시지를 보내는 형식으로 이제 액션을 수행을 하게 되는 거죠 그래서 다음은 이제 실제 봇 서버에 있는 다이스 커맨드를 담당하는 파이썬 코드입니다 그래서 실제 레스 API 페이로드로 온 제이슨을 파싱을 해 준 뒤에 뭐 이벤트 콜백 타입이면서 맨션이 이벤트인 경우에 이제 해당 분기를 타게 됩니다 그래서 제가 의도한 다이스 커맨드 형식이 맞는지를 이제 정규 표현식으로 이제 검증을 하는 부분이 이제 저기서 확인하실 수가 있는데 실제로 이러한 도스에서는 이런 채팅 기반의 인터페이스가 주된 소통 수단이기 때문에 정규 표현식을 알고 계시면 여러 가지 기능을 구현하실 때 굉장히 도움이 되는 편입니다 또 그를 통해서 커맨드 검증이 된다면 이제 숫자를 추출을 해서 그의 범위에 맞는 숫자 중 뭐 랜덤으로 숫자를 선정을 하여 또 슬의 포스트 메시지를 통해서 사용자에게 메시지를 전달을 하게 되는 그런 형식입니다 그래서 만약 이제 정규표현식을 통해서 다이스 커맨드의 패턴이 일치를 한다면 위에서 제가 준비한 숫자를 추 커맨드가 서버로 반환을 하게 되고요 만약에 반대로 알 수 없는 커맨드가 입력돼 즉 이제 증 정규 표현식의 패턴이 매칭되지 않은 경우에는 예외처리 메시지를 반환을 시켜 주었습니다 그래서이 이문 문으로 그 경계를 그냥 쉽게 확인하실 수가 있죠 그래서 좀 더 응용을 해 볼 수도 있습니다 만약에 자신이 또 다른 커맨드를 추가하고 싶다면 이제이 사이에 좀 더 다양한 스 이문 분기기를 넣어서 자신이 원하는 로직을 추가함으로써 봇에 다양한 기능을 넣고 추가로 기능을 구현을 해 볼 수 있을 것입니다 다음은 이제 부 서비스와 기능을 통합하는 예제를 한번 생각을 해 보았습니다 그래서 가령 뭐 어떤 회사에서 노션을 통해서 휴가나 재택을 이제 관리를 하고 있다라고 가정을 해보았습니다 그래서 어떤 팀에서 어떤 팀원이 슬랙에서 미팅을 요청하려고 하는데 각 인원들의 휴가나 이제 재택 여부를 확인을 해야 하는데 일일이 노션에 들어가는게 굉장히 귀찮거나 번거로울 수 있겠죠 그래서 이제 슬랙의 짧은 명령을 하나로 전체 팀원의 휴가나 재택을 좀 조회 가능하면 어떨까하고 간단하게 아이디어를 짜내 보았 습니다 그래서 다음 그림과 같이 이제 슬래시 100이라고 커맨드 명령을 입력을 하면 노션에 있는 데이터베이스에 접근을 하여 정보를 출력해 주는 기능을 한번 생각을 해 보았습니다 그래서 슬랙의 커맨드 기능은 이제 다음과 같은 동작 구조를 가집니다 사용자가 슬래시로 시작하는 커맨드와 추가적인 파라미터를 채팅으로 입력을 하면이를 슬렉 서버에 전달을 하게 되는데요 슬렉 서버는 별도의 과정을 거친 후 해당 서버일 http 리퀘스트에 담아 보 서버 축으로 포워딩을 해주게 됩니다 보 서버는 이제 해당 리퀘스트를 레스트 API 실행을 하게 되고 리스폰스를 다시 슬렉 서버 측으로 반환을 하게 됩니다 슬랙은 이제 다시 그 결과값을 검증을 하고 다시 그 결과값을 클라이언트 앱으로 전달하는 이제 구조이죠 근데 여기서 이제 유의해야 할 점이 한 가지가 있는데 봇서버 측이 점유할 수 있는 시간이 최대 3초 정도라는 점입니다 그래서 그 이상이 소요되는 기능이라면 일단 리스폰스를 빠르게 반환을 한 뒤에 나머지 동작들을 백그라운드에서 실행시키는 형태로 취하는 등의 구현을 할 필요가 있습니다 그래서 커맨드 같은 경우에는 미리 이제 또 슬렉 봇에 또 관리 페이지 또 사전에 또 등록하는 커맨드를 미리 등록해 줘야 하는 등으로 오른쪽 페이지에 보시면 또 호출이 가능하다는 점도 또 유의를 할 필요가 있고요 그래서이 두 가지를 유의를 하서 구현을 진행을 하면 됩니다 그래서 다음 페이지에가 보시면 이제 커맨드 API 같은 경우는 좀 간단하게 이렇게 구현이 되어 있는데요 크게 두 가지로 나눠 볼 수가 있습니다 첫 번째는 이제 노션 API 사용을 해서 노션에 있는 휴가 디비에 접근을 하여 휴가및 재택 현황 데이터를 가져오는 부분이고요 두 번째는 이제 해당 정보를 정제를 하고 이제 리트 베케이션스 이제 슬랙의 좀 뭐랄까 예쁜 메시지 템플릿으로 꾸며 준 후에 사용자에게 리스폰스를 반환을 하는 과정입니다 그래서 첫 번째 같은 경우에는 사실이 메소드 내부 구현 부분을 보시면 그냥 단순히 http 통신을 통해 노션 API 호출하는 구문입니다 그래서 노션 API 제공하는 뭐 문법과 코리를 적절히 그냥 제이슨 바디를 활용을 하여 제가 필요한 휴가 재택 정보를 적절히 호출을 해 보았습니다 그래서 보시면 아시겠지만 그저 http 리퀘스트를 요청할 뿐이기 때문에이 부분을 바꾸어서 노션뿐만 아니라 다양한 이제 외부 API 연동을 하여 다른 기능을 구현하실 수도 있습니다 즉 충분히 이제 다양한 외부 API 호출을 가능할 수가 있겠죠 자 그다음은 이제 리센트 베이스라는 기체입니다이 부분 같은 경우에는 이제 슬랙에서 사용자에게 이제 메시지를 출려 해줄 때 노션에서 불러온 데이터를 이제 단순 평문으로 출력을 한다라다는 이제 다음 그림처럼 이제 메시지를 뭐 날짜별로 그루핑 해주고 이모지 같은 것도 붙여주면 이제 가독성이 훨씬 좋아지겠죠 그래서 슬랙에서 이런 메시지를 이제 블록 단위로 좀 꾸며 줄 수 있는 블로 키이라는 도구가 존재합니다 그래서 리트 베케션 아는 객체는이 노션에서 가져온 정보를 블로 킷의 문법에 맞게 변환을 하고 사용자가 보기 좋게 변환해 주는 객체를 제가 직접 이렇게 만들어 본 것입니다 네 그래서이 블로 키이라는 것은 일종에 이제 슬의 메시지 UI 컴포넌트라고 말씀을 드릴 수가 있는데요 사용자에게 출력되는 메시지를 다양한 요소로 코드 베이스로 구축을 할 수 있는 도구입니다 그래서 뭐 텍스트나 이모지 외에도 뭐 체크박스 라디오 텍스트 인풋 약간 슬의 html 같은 느낌이라고 보시면 약간 이해하시기 좀 좋을 것 같아요 그래서이 해당 웹페이지는 이제 슬랙에서 제공하는 블로키 더라는 앱인데요 직접 쪽에서 제공하는 컴포넌트를 사용을 해서이 블로키 메시지를 직접 만들어 볼 수가 있습니다 그래서이를 통해서 만들어진 블로키 a 페이로드는 그 바로 오른쪽에서 실시간으로 표시가 되게 되는데요이 모든 페이로드는 전부 제이슨으로 작성이 되어 있기 때문에 일방적인 프로그래밍 언어의 이식성이 굉장히 좋은 편입니다 그래서 이러한 블로 킷으로 적절하게 디자인을 한 뒤에 그 제이슨을 기반으로 이제 파이썬에서는 이제 딕셔너리와 리스트로 적절하게 그 블록 킷을 꾸며 주면 되겠죠 그래서 저 같은 경우에는 그 휴가 정보를 동쪽으로 가져와서 포프 같은 형태로 이제 동쪽으로 이렇게 구현을 하는 로직으로 한번 작성을 해 보았습니다 그래서 이런 식으로 저희가 이제이 블로키 빌더에서 디자인을 한 뒤에 실제로 출력되는 형태는 이제 런 식으로이 출력을 해 볼 수가 있겠죠네 그리고 이제 마지막은 어찌 보면 이제 좀 으로서는 가장 잘 어울리는 일명 AI 비서라는 기능을 한번 보여 드리려고 합니다 그래서 다들 이제 채치 PT 이름을 다들 이제 들어 보셨을지 모르겠습니다 그래서 해당 기능은 그 일반적인 채지 PT 채팅을 하는 거를 이제 슬랙에서 비스라 복과 DM 통해서 해보는 걸로 구현을 하는 것입니다 그래서이는 이제 맨 처음에 설명드린 주사의 기능과 마찬가지로 이제 이벤트 API 사용을 하는데요 이번에는 지점이라고 하는 이벤트를 사용을 하는데 그건 이제 봇과 DM 했을 때 전송이 되는 그 이벤트를 기반으로이를 감지를 하게 됩니다 그래서 해 해당 이벤트가 감지되었을 때는 DM 도착한 그 텍스트 전문을 그대로 오픈 AI 는 LM 전송을 하고 그 리스폰스를 다시 사용자에게 쏴 주는 형태로 구현을 진행을 하게 됩니다 여기서 굉장히 주의해야할 점이 있는데 오픈 AI 즉 그 채치 PT 실행 시간이 굉장히 느릴 수 있다는 점이에요 그래서 단순히 해당 리스폰스가 동기적으로 기다리게 된다면 3 4분씩 소요되는 케이스도 굉장히 적지 않았었습니다 그래서 때문에 저는 그 해당 기능이 실행이 되면 일단 그 체포 모듈 부분을 비동기적으로 분리를 시켰고 그 API 리스폰스를 일단 슬래한테 반환을 해서 아 그 이벤트는 완료됐어요 라고 리스폰스를 반환을 해 준 뒤에 채지 pts 리스폰스가 도착을 하면 메시지를 백그라운드로 발송하는 형태로 구현을 진행을 해 보았습니다 그래서 이렇게 그 메시지를 백 백그라운드에서 비동기적으로 실행하는 부분에는 다양한 방법이 있을 수가 있는데 저 같은 경우에는 정말 다행히도 운좋게 좌파에서 싱크로너스 테스크는 모드를 내부해 지원을 하고 있었습니다 그래서이 싱크로너스 테스크 아는 데코레이터 존재하는데이 데코레이터를 감싸진 함수를이 람다 인스턴스에서 실행을 하게 되면 해당 함수가 동일한 인스턴스가 아니라 바로 새로운 람다 인스턴스를 생성하고 그쪽으로 그 함수를 바로 던져서 비동기적으로 실행을 하게 됩니다 그래서이를 통해서 기존의 해당 함수는 그 호출한 리퀘스트 콘텍스트가 그 결과를 기다리지 않고 바로 리스폰스를 반환을 하고 제가 이제 비동기적으로 떼서 실행을 하고 싶은 부분은 다른 람다에서 실행을 하고 있는 그런 구조죠 그래서 만약에 이제 자파를 쓰고 계시다면 이걸 좀 편하게 구현을 할 수가 있었는데 이게 만약에 안 된다고 한다면 이제 외 부의 어떤 테스크 큐를 활용을 한다거나 혹은 이제 법서 패턴으로 좀 다른 의존적인 방식으로 비동기 동작 방식을 구현해 볼 필요가 있을 것 같습니다 그래서 일단은 이제 해당 모듈 내부에서는 대표적으로 세 가지 동작으로 구성이 되어 있는데요 일단 첫 번째는 이제 슬랙 API ES 컨버세이션 히스토리 메소드라고 해서 이제 과거 내가 봇과 했던 DM 대화 기록을 가져옵니다 지티의 그 동작 구조가 그렇거든요 자기가 과거에 했던 대화 기록을 싹 다 넘기고 그래서 다음 우리 대화를 예측을 하는 그런 구조라서이 대화 기록이 필요하고요 그다음 두 번째로는 이제 오픈 AI ES 원하는 형태로 대화 데이터를 정제를 하는 과정이 들어 있고요 그리고 마지막으로는 그 대화 기록을 통째로 lnm 테 넘겨서 받은 리스폰스를 다시 받아와 다시 슬의 챗 포스트 메시지 메소드로 사용자에게 dml 송신을 하는 그런 구조입니다 그 다음 코드는 이제 오픈 AI LM게 채팅 기록을 전송을 하는 제가 만든 이제 샌드 LG 텍스트라는 함수인데요 상단에 선언되어 있는이 시스템 텍스트라는 변수가 채치 2에게 초기 프롬프트 역할로 지정을 해 줄 수 있습니다 그래서 현재는 제가 샘플로 간단하게 그냥 작성이 되어 있어요 뭐 너는 굉장히 도움이 되는 자비스는 어시스턴트 너는 토니가 아버지고 알로카 스를 위해서 돕는다 이런 식으로 제가 그냥 작성을 했지만 여기에 사실 이제 여러 가지 각자의 회사 핏에 맞는 뭐 매뉴얼을 준다거나 풍성하게 이제 가이드라인을 구성을 해 준다면 뭐 이런 질문 할 수 있겠죠 뭐 우리 회사 와이파이 비밀번호가 뭐냐 아니면 우리 회사 대문 비밀번호가 뭐냐 이런 거 만들어 볼 수 있겠죠 그래서 즉 그 프롬프트 설정에 따라서 각 팀의 핏에 맞는 AI 비서를 구축해 볼 수가 있을 것입니다네 그래서 실제로 이렇게 자비스를 만들어서 dml 통해서 AI 체포 기능을 사용해 본 예제입니다 그래서 파이썬으로 뭐 하노이탑 기능을 짜 봐라 그리고 그다음에 이거를 좀 꼬아서 제기로 짜지 말라라고 추가적인 질문을 던져 본다거나 뭐 변수 이름 추천 받는다거나 아니면 뭐 야식 추천 받는다거나 뭐 이런 식으로 사실 뭐 집에서 하는 기능 그대로 갖고 온 거죠네 그래서 사실 뭐 1 2년 전만 하더라도 이러한 AI 체포를 구현하는게 굉장히 힘들었다고 생각하는데 지금은 정말 구현하기가 쉬워져서 꼭 한번 공유를 들여보고 싶었습니다 다들 이제 슬랙을 통해서 이어하는 각 팀에 맞는 AI 비서 하나씩 구비해 보시는 건 어떠실지 한번 추천을 드려 봅니다 그래서 지금까지 저와 함께 한 세 가지 정도 시나리오를 통해서 슬랙 활영 사례를 함께 확인해 보셨습니다 하지만 사실 이외에도 아이디어나 기능 사례는 정말 무궁무진합니다 다음은 이제 저희가 저희 팀의 슬랙 봇에 실제로 구현된 기능 중 일부인데요 그래서 뭐 슬랙의 메시지를 작성을 하면 실제 노션이 지라에서 자동으로 티켓을 발행을 한다거나 아니면 매달 aws 클라우드에서 청구되는 비용을 보고서로 작성을 하여 특정 채널에 슬랙으로 쏜다거나 혹은 슬랙에 있는 뭐 온오프라인 같은 거를 감지를 해서 자동으로 이제 출퇴근 장부를 기록을 한다거나 아니면 특정 서비스의 모니터링 지표를 그 각 슬랙의 본다 뷰라는게 있습니다 굉장히 간편하게 볼 수 있는 뷰가 있는데 그 뷰에서 바로바로 지표를 확인할 수 있게 한다거나 아니면 여러분들이 aws 콘솔에 접근할 때마다 그게 보안 어떤 엔지니어 분에게 시큐리티 엔지니어 분들에게 알람이 가게 한다거나 엄청 다양한 기능들을 구현을 할 수가 있겠죠 마지막으로는 이제 제가 붙인게 알아서 검색하고 뭐 생각하고 요약해 주는 오터 서치라고 제가 일단 이름을 붙여 보았는데요 이거 같은 경우에는 이제 자비스가 특정 검색어를 던져주면 자비스가 스스로 생각하고 의견 내서 인터넷에서 검색을 해보고 해당 결과를 바탕으로 결과를 요약해 주는 기능입니다 예를 들면 주식회사 알로카 스는 무 하는 회사야고 했는데 첼시 PT 당연히 이거를 모릅니다 근데 이제 아 나는 이거를 모르기 때문에 구글에 검색을 한번 해 봐야겠다고 해서 구글에 검색을 해 보고 그리고 아 구글에 검색해 보니까 이렇더라 그래서 알로카 스는 이런 회사인 거 같아라는 식으로 이제 결론을 내리는 뭐 이런 과정 같은 경우도 재밌게 좀 구현을 해 볼 수가 있었습니다 그래서 저 같은 경우는 이거를 파이썬의 랭 체인이라는 라이브러리로 좀 쉽게 구현을 해 봤는데 이외에도 다양한 방법이 있겠죠 그래서 제가 말씀드리고 싶은 것은이 체스하는게 자연어 철이나 자연어 생선 기반의 분야와 굉장히 조합이 좋은 편입니다 그리고이 또한이 AI 분야의 여러 패키지나 라이브러리들이 파이썬에 주로 분포되어 있다는 것도 여러분들 아마 잘 아시겠죠 그래서 이런 것들로 미루어 보야 저는 개인적으로이 AI 기반의 체수 그리고이 파이썬의 궁합이 굉장히 큰 기대가 되지 않나라고 개인적으로 생각을 품고 있습니다네 그래서 마지막 은 이제 슬랙앱 디렉토리에 대해서 간단하게 짚어 넘어가 보자 합니다 보통은 이제 슬랙에서 사용되는 슬랙 포은 보통 내부에서만 사용되는 경우가 많겠지만 만약이를 퍼블릭으로 배포하고 싶을 경우에는 이제 슬랙의 심사를 거쳐서 앱 디렉토리라고 하는 일종의 앱스토어 같은 곳에 이제 개시를 할 수가 있습니다 그래서 이렇게 하시게 되면 이제 슬랙봇 다른 유저들 다른 사람들이 스토어에서 쇼핑을 하듯이 살펴보고 다 자신들이 워크스페이스에 설치가 가능하기 때문에 슬랙봇 이제 상품으로서 이제 프로덕트로 설 출시가 가능한 데요 이미 이제 이름이 알려 널리 알려진 여러 다양한 서비스들이 출시되어 있고 이미 상당한 규모의 생태계가 슬랙에 조성되어 있습니다 그래서 이제 대표적으로 두 가지 정도의 앱을 예로 들어보자면 일단 가장 먼저 정말 많이 사용하시는 기 브가 있죠 그래서 기본적으로 기터브 발생하는 뭐 PR 이슈 커밋 뭐 코멘트 액션 여러 이벤트를 발생했을 때 슬랙의 메신저가 푸시를 해 주는 것부터 시작을 해서 기터 브에서 가능했던 여러 다양한 액션을 슬랙에서 뭐 수행을 가능하도록 도와줍니다 두 번째는 저희 알로카 스에서 운영하고 있는 그레이라는 슬랙앱 같은 것도 있습니다 그래서 그레이시는 이제 HR 어시스턴트로 이제 팀원들의 약간 사내문화 증진을 목표로 하고 있는 앱인데요 뭐 고마음을 전화고 픈 팀원들에게 칭찬 메시지를 전달한다거나 아니면 매일마다 약간 재밌는 토픽을 던져줘서 대화의 장을 열어 주는 등 약간 건강한 산회 문화 조성을 목표로 하고 있습니다 그래서 약간 혹시라도 이제이 세션을 듣고 약간 산의 슬랙을 만들어 보고자 한다고 하신다면 일단은 앱 디렉토리를 먼저 살펴 보시고 이미 만들어진 앱이 있을 수 있기 때문에 그걸 먼저 보시고 없다라고 하면 개발에 도전해 보시는게 약간 일단 시간을 좀 비용을 줄일 수가 있다라는게 약간 제 말의 의도였습니다 그래서 마지막으로는 이제 본 세션을 정리하는 장입니다네 처음으로는 이제 취미삼아 시작했던 프로젝트가 지금은 이제 제법 팀들의 팀원들의 주목을 받아 있는 슬랙봇이 되었습니다 그래서 은근히 팀원들이 자을 사용하는 모습이 이제 모니터에 비치거나 그런 이런 것들에 대한 어떤 칭찬이나 이런 피드백이 남겨주실 때 아 잘 사용하고 계시구나 하고 이제 꽤 보람을 느끼고 있는 것 같습니다 그래서 만약 여러분들도 이제 팀이나 어떤 회사에서 이런 비슷한 문제나 니즈를 가지고 계시다면 파이썬을 사용해서 쉽게 이제 체스를 도입해 보시는 건 어떠실지 아마 추천을 드려보고 싶습니다 이상 발표를 마치도록 하겠습니다 [음악] 감사합니다\n",

디자인의 스펙트럼 있으면 가장 왼쪽 가장 파운데이션 행위 이제 디트 엔지니어링 곡 가운데 가 엣 언 lss 크니까 분석하는 거고 와 생 아기 모델링 뭐가 진짜 파이 친히 해가지고 가 엔진 1 돌리고 모습 모델 자꾸 하는게 이제 가장 극과극 이라고 이렇게 쭉 스펙트럼을 정리를 해보면 각자 회상하다 유명한 때가 달라요 우리가 흔히들 말하는 모델링의 관련된 게 매트릭스 가요 5달에 가운데에는 3 있으 긍까 언어를 쓰 가 가장 유명한 회사는 은 베이스볼 게 아닐까 싶고 그 다음에 엔지니어링이 가장 유명한 데는 모르겠어요 근데 플렉스가 살짝 유명하다고 또한 흔들릴 슬랙 같은 경우는 사실 그렇게 머신 러닝 모델을 많이 돌리고 슈니 해야 될 것들이 막 그렇게 많지는 않아요 왜 그만 레이 션 기반으로 이루어진 서비스가 아니기 때문에 저희는 어떻게 만 탁자 돌아가는 걸로 이루어지는 회사이기 때문에 그게 엄청 발전 하진 않았는데 저희 약간 취미에 특성상 다 해야 되는 특성이 있어요 그래서 요새는 제가 엔진 여행 일을 많이 하고 있는데 예 그래서 좀 그 구조도 좀 봐야 돼 얼마나 많이 뽑는 질 봐야돼 회사마다 다르고 구성하다 다르고 침만 다르다 그 2 슬랙 은 지금 데이터 사이의 택지 데이터 사이언티스트 안 람 명 정도 있는 조치 알아 1 수 밖에 없어요 슬레 계산은 그럼 데이터 사이언티스트 미 어반 데이 팔에 분석을 하고 그러한 법 근데 글에서는 인사이트 같은걸 혈압의 어떻게 적용해 제가 있는 팀은 이제 소셜 네트워크 라고 하는데 힘은 고치며 어떻게 연결되어 있는지 또 어떤 올 그가 연결되는지를 분석하고 유저와 유저가 어떻게 연결되는지 그때 우리 회사가 과연 커뮤니케이션을 잘하는 회사 일까 이거에 대한 질문이 되게 많거든요 그래서 이것을 사용을 자라고 있는 것입니까 라고 하는 질문에 대해서 그런거에 대한 이제 스쿠버 추가를 매길 수가 있어요 그래서 그런 스포 버티고 매길 때 쓸 수 있는 방식이 언 네트워크 네트워크 락스를 이제 이용하는 건데 그 그래프가 얼마나 타이가 러 얼마나 진하고 얼마나 이렇게 여러가지 이렇게 오래 커플 키드 를 이용해 가지고 이 사람이 어떤 사람과 연결되어 있으면 자른 사람과도 연결 되겠구나 뭐에 대한 예측을 할 수가 있어요 그래서 그런 클래스를 가지고 분석을 하고 그것을 가지 모델링 이용해 가지고 뭐 앞으로의 관계를 예측한다는 g 그런걸 하는거 를 저는 하고 있구요 그리고 저희 팀은 조금 더 나아가서 그런 네트워크 그래프를 이용해서 팀과 침에 관계 라든지 어떻게 하면 조금 더 스프레드를 많이 시킬 수 있을지 빠르게 시킬 수 있을지 그런걸로 분석하고 또 예측하는 일을 하고 있죠 어 그리고 따른 치은 같은 경우는 몸의 쎄지 의 양을 분석하다 는지 아니면 어머 채팅에 양을 분석하는 한다든지 그런거를 하고요 예 그렇습니다 어 그러면 내가 슬랙 을 쓰는 쓰다 보면 좀 신기했던 기능이 자모 있을 법한 뒤는 얘기했는데 벨 톰 그 산의 어떤 채널 몇 개의 가입해 슬기를 하고 있으면 가끔 그런 추천이 와 너 가 2ch 2002 채널의 있는데 세차가 있는 사람은 텐트 초기 이런이런 인 채널의 건 입찰할 피할 수 있으니까 들어 가라고 했지 하나 있고 그 다음 거는 제 내가 그 채널을 2 킥 조이는 해놨는데 뭐 밑줄을 해 낮거나 그 좀 소홀히 하는 채널 있으면 여기 여기 여기 는 2가지 난다 달 동안 거의 인터랙션이 어떤 채널이 니세 뭐 학생은 나 나도 이런거 치는데 그런 스코어 메뉴에 가면 데이터 사용됐을 낌이 a 탑 응답을 통해서 계속 주는 거구나 음 그쵸 네 그거 이제 서치 팀이 하는건데 맞아요 예 그런것을 많이 분석하자 거의 내 오빠가 서부는 사실 하는 것 같은

조금 더 그 유저에 대한 이해를 하기가 쉬워요 그래서 저희는 되게 슬래그 또 좋은 이유가 뭐냐면 200 스루 이라는게 있는데 박물관 처럼 생겼어요 그래서 여기 가운데 엄청 큰 통유리 가 되어 있고 사람들이 뭘 해요 그러면 기회는 질문을 던져 여 어 너 이거 한번 멧세지 보내 본래 하면은 거기 직접 그 자리에서 그 실험하는 사람들한테 이제 랩탑을 주고 하게

경험으로 쳐서 데이터 사이언티스트 갱은 경우가 있는데 더는 그 학부에서 수학을 전공했으며 듣고 수학을 정보 함과 동시에 컴퓨터 공부를 살짝 했어요 그때 b 한거는 차를 다 많이 까먹고 5 좀 기억이 안나는데 사탑에서 일을 하면서 컴퓨터 코딩 도 같이 공부를 하고 혼자서 마퀴 더 가지고 델리 인도 들려보고 5 그런 식으로 연습을 했던 것 같아요 첫 회사라

자그마치 7 좀 한국돈으로 세븐 빌리언 달라 빌 년 방아 굉장히 자기가 지금 갖고 인쇄가 많기 때문에 이런 그런 ceo 들은 이 회사를 위해서 거의 뭐 목숨을 바치지 5 그게 이제 종전 인 것 같습니다 조금 리스크 아닌 디스크 좀 안 좋은 점은요 씨가 굉장히 많은 일하고 있어요 그 좋은 점이 수도 있지만 좀 디스크 일수도 있죠 왜냐하면 좀 ceo 가 56세 구요 뭐 길어봤자 십 년도 할텐데 치료가 않으니 너무 많으며 썩 센서로 찾기가 좀 힘들어요 빌게이츠 도 대단했지만 그 다음에 왔던 스티브 발머가 좀 이거 삐 됐죠 좀 힘들었고 스티브 잡스도 처음에 seo 를 세웠을 때 잘못에 었지요 팝 cc 2호 하던 사람 될 거다 생각보다 가작 에서 쫓겨나 도모 애플 거의 망할 지경까지 하게 되는데요 그래서 처음 ceo 에서 두 번째로 넘어가 그가 행정이 좀 클릭 거라고 중요한데 고보 가 좀 리스크가 될 수가 있구요 그리고 22 와 굉장히 많은 일을 하고 있어요 슬랙 이랑 제지를 할 때 슬래그 살 때도 자기가 찾아서 자기가 d 라고 슬래그 사들였습니다 그리고 c 이어가 슬렉스 귀여워라 계속 얘기를 하면서 이제 지를 성사시켜 찌 요 ceo 가 너무 많은 일을 하고 있다면 좀 다음에 하기가 두번째는 제발 리에이션 굉장히 봐요 어 모든 회사가 좋겠지만 이 회사 또한 발리 션은 굉장히 높습니다 지금 번 돈의 급히 기회 시어가 1 52 정도 되구요 그리고 3 1 이제 8세를 하면 거의 열 배가 넘습니다 아 뭐 그게 뭐 높은 뭐냐 이렇게 말을 할 수 있겠지만 이 쓰여서 울스 같은걸 어떤 그 수준의 벌써 왔어요 이거는 스타 러비 아니에요 rp 와 57 연신 왔구요 수준이 좀 올라간 상태기 때문에 스타 러브 로 볼 수가 없다 해서 뭐 없으 타트 나 저번에 이래도 소파 이나 모유로 뭐 라는 비교하기가 좀 그렇습니다 왜냐하면 더 이상 모임에 손을 받을 수 있는 것도 아니고 어느 정도 궤도에 올라갔기 때문에 그렇게 되면 성장하기도 좀 힘들어 지고 하기 때문에 좀 이 수치들이 그래도 좀 낮아져야 되는데 좀 그렇지 않다 그냥 깐 점 스타 럽 수준에 있다는 색도 매출액이 고개 좋은 이제 리스크 아닌 리스크 좀 안좋은 점이 될 수 가 있는데요 어 돈을 계속 이렇게 잘 번다면 그게 나아질 것 같고 아직까지 성장률이 25% 에서 20% 로 왔다갔다 하기 때문에 괜찮다 그렇다면 이제 빨리 자 마지막으로 보았거든요 과 0 모닝스타 에서는 빼어 발 얼만지 인출 렌즈 빨리 올 얼마를 보고 있는지 볼 보겠습니다 지금 페어 만류를 273 불 로 보고 있습니다 지금 주식 값이 249 불 정도 되니까요 거의 뭐 1 8% 에서 7% 아니면 9% 고정도 디스카운트 로 살 수 있다 그리고 스타는 폴스타 해요 그래서 좀 싸다 라고 보고 있어요 전 이게 좀 놀라웠어요 왜냐하면 모든 매출 기록 높기 때문에 좀 비싸다고 얘기하지 않을까 라고 생각을 했는데 그 제안을 모닝스타 에서도 지금 좀 싸다 라고 얘기를 하고 있습니다 깐 좀 저는 몰랐어요 근데 이 모닝스타 에서 보이세요 소스가 되게 좋게 보고 있어요 아마존은 인터넷에서 자기 엠파이어 완전 자기의 세상을 만들고 있잖아요 그래서 뭐 이것도 사고 저것도 사고 그리고 책도 하고 비디오도 하는데 이 센 소스는 비즈니스 상대로 한 쿼드 비즈니스에서 정말 자기의 세상을 만들어 없을 엠파이어 를 만들겠어요 그래서 그 모닝스타 에서도 있은 소스 설명할 때 이렇게 서는 요 제목이 세어 소울 사악함 게 베어 등은 엠파일 조언 전자기 엠파이어 를 만들고 있다 세상을 만들겠다 이렇게 얘기하는데 저도 거기에 어느정도 동감합니다 지금 보니까 굉장히 좀 많은 회사 웹 썰을 하고 있고 특히나 커라 얻은 아 데이터 쪽에 고 쪽에 굉장히 말이 투자를 하고 있어요 거의 손을 안 뻗친 곳이 없습니다 수 없으 좋아 박스 수에 뭐 여러가지 회사의 손을 뻗치고 있고 터치 임하고 있습니다 그리고 게라 에리카는 그런 쪽 마 회사들의 굉장히 투자를 많이 하고 있고 또 굉장히 많이 사들이고 있어요 그래서 데이터 사이언스 나고 쪽에도 ai 쪽에도 좀 미래에 어떻게 걸 이용하지 모르겠지만 준비는 하고 있다 그렇다면 절어 살 건가 약간 지는 비싸 잇다고 보여줘요 제 개인적인 입장에서 뭐 1x4 인천시 빨리는 지금이 좀 싸다 오르지만 저는 좀 비싸다고 보여집니다 시가 좀 높고 주가 자체가 굉장히 높아 있는 상태라서 200불 위치로 가면 사겠어요 200불 미추가 며 굉장히 좀 매력적이다 라고 볼 수가 있습니다 하지만 지금 당장 사도 지금 모닝 스타 에서는 좀 싸다 그리고 tmf 에서는 메카 만들 하고 있기 때문에 무방하지 않을까 라고 생각이 되어 지고 이 회사는 조금 마음에 드는게 어느 정도 궤도에 있어요 지금 보유하고 있는 캐시도 굉장히 많고 거의 못 할 조 이상이 있고 그리고 돈 버는 것도 굉장히 스타일리 하게 지금 벌고 있고 하 5년째 그 어느 정도 궤도에 들어왔다 그리고 애꾸 지셔야 많이 하고 있기 때문에 또한 갖은 ceo 가 파운더 기 때문에 지금부턴 5년에서 7년 까지는 굉장히 조 안정 궤도 있지 않을까 라는 생각을 해봅니다 왜 오늘은 tmf 에서 8월달에 베컴 & 하고 있는 ces 볼스 닷컴 센스 몰수를 좀 1기 해봤습니다 처음에 와 도움이 됐음 좋겠어요 이렇게 끝까지 영상을 봐주셔서 너무 감사합니다 지금까지 높이겠습니다 감사합니다 으 으 으 으 으 [음악]\n",
